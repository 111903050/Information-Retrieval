Preface
Dear Students,
With great pleasure we place this detailed text book on basic physics in the hands of
the young generation. This is not only a textbook of physics for XIIth standard, but contains
material that will be useful for the reader for self study.
This textbook aims to give the student a broad perspective to look into the physics
aspect in various phenomena they experience. The National Curriculum Framework (NCR)
was formulated in the year 2005, followed by the State Curriculum Framework (SCF) in
2010. Based on the given two frameworks, reconstruction of the curriculum and preparation
of a revised syllabus has been undertaken which will be introduced from the academic year
2020-21. The textbook incorporating the revised syllabus has been prepared and designed
by the Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook Production and Curriculum Research,
(Balbharati), Pune.
The objective of bringing out this book is to prepare students to observe and analyse
various physical phenomena is the world around them and prepare a solid foundation for
those who aspire for admission to professional courses through competitive examinations.
Most of the chapters in this book assume background knowledge of the subject covered by
the text book for XIth Standard, and care has been taken of mentioning this in the appropriate
sections of the book. The book is not in the form of handy notes but embodies a good
historical background and in depth discussion as well. A number of solved examples in
every chapter and exercises at the end of each one of them are included with a view that
students will acquire proficiency and also will get enlightened after solving the exercises.
Physics is a highly conceptual subject. Problem solving will enable students understand the
underlying concepts. For students who want more, boxes entitled ‘Do you know?’ have been
included at a number of places.
If you read the book carefully and solve the exercises in each chapter, you will
be well prepared to face the challenges of this competitive world and pave the way for a
successful career ahead.
The efforts taken to prepare the textbook will prove to be worthwhile if you read the
textbook and understand the subject. We hope it will be a wonderful learning experience for
you and an illuminating text material for teachers too.

Dear Teachers,
We are happy to introduce the revised
textbook of Physics for XIIth standard. This
book is a sincere attempt to follow the
maxims of teaching as well as develop a
‘constructivist’ approach to enhance the
quality of learning. The demand for more
activity based, experiential and innovative
learning opportunities is the need of the
hour. The present curriculum has been
restructured so as to bridge the credibility
gap that exists between what is taught and
what students learn from direct experience
in the outside world. Guidelines provided
below will help to enrich the teachinglearning process and achieve the desired
learning outcomes.
To begin with, get familiar with the
textbook yourself, and encourage the
students to read each chapter carefully.
The present book has been prepared for
constructivist and activity-based teaching,
including problem solving exercises.
Use teaching aids as required for proper
understanding of the subject.
Do not finish the chapter in short. However,
in the view of insufficient lectures, standard
derivations may be left to the students for
self study. Problem sloving must be given
due importance.
Follow the order of the chapters strictly as
listed in the contents because the units are

introduced in a graded manner to facilitate
knowledge building.
'Error in measurements' is an important
topic in physics. Please ask the students to
use this in estimating errors in their
measurements. This must become an
integral part of laboratory practices.
Major concepts of physics have a scientific
base. Encourage group work, learning
through each other’s help, etc. Facilitate
peer learning as much as possible by
reorganizing the class structure frequently.
Do not use the boxes titled ‘Do you know?’
or ‘Use your brain power’ for evaluation.
However, teachers must ensure that students
read this extra information and think about
the questions posed.
For evaluation, equal weightage should be
assigned to all the topics. Use different
combinations of questions. Stereotype
questions should be avoided.
Use Q.R. Code given in the textbook. Keep
checking the Q.R. Code for updated
information. Certain important links, websites
have been given for references. Also a list
of reference books is given. Teachers as well
as the students can use these references for
extra reading and in-depth understanding of
the subject.
Best wishes for a wonderful teaching
experience!

2. What is the concept of centre of mass?
3. What are kinematical equations of
motion?
4. Do you know real and pseudo forces,
their origin and applications?
1.1 Introduction:
Circular motion is an essential part of our
daily life. Every day we come across several
revolving or rotating (rigid) objects. During
revolution, the object (every particle in the
object) undergoes circular motion about some
point outside the object or about some other
object, while during rotation the motion is about
an axis of rotation passing through the object.
1.2 Characteristics of Circular Motion:
1) It is an accelerated motion: As the
direction of velocity changes at every
instant, it is an accelerated motion.
2) It is a periodic motion: During the motion,
the particle repeats its path along the same
trajectory. Thus, the motion is periodic.
1.2.1 Kinematics of Circular Motion:
As seen in XIth Std, in order to describe
a circular motion, we  use the quantities

Here, the position vector r is the radius
vector from the centre

The magnitude of v is v = ω r.

Direction of ω is always along the axis of
rotation and is given by the right-hand thumb

rule. To know the direction of ω , curl the fingers

Uniform circular motion: During circular
motion if the speed of the particle remains
constant, it is called Uniform Circular Motion
(UCM). In this case, only the direction of its
velocity changes at every instant in such a way
that the velocity is always tangential to the
path. The acceleration responsible for this is

Illustration: Circular motion of any particle

never its magnitude thereby continuously

If the angular acceleration α is

and along the axis of rotation, all  , and
will be directed along the axis. This makes it
possible to use scalar notation and write the
kinematical equations of motion analogous to
those for translational motion as given in the
table 1 at the end of the topic.

During this time, it is a non-uniform circular
motion. As the velocity is still tangential, the

centripetal or radial acceleration a r is still
there. However, for non-uniform circular

motion, the magnitude of a r is not constant.
The acceleration responsible for changing
the magnitude of velocity is directed along
or opposite to the velocity, hence always
tangential and is called as tangential

acceleration a T .

As magnitude of tangential velocity v
is changing during a non-uniform circular

motion, the corresponding angular velocity ω
is also changing at every instant. This is due to
 d
the angular acceleration  
dt
Though the motion is non-uniform, the
particles are still in the same plane. Hence,

the direction of α is still along the axis of
rotation. For increasing speed, it is along the

direction of ω while during decreasing speed,

it is opposite to that of ω .

Example 1: A fan is rotating at 90 rpm.
It is then switched OFF. It stops after 21
revolutions. Calculate the time taken by it

It must be understood that centrifugal
force is a non-real force, but NOT an
imaginary force. Remember, before the merrygo-round reaches its uniform speed, you were
really experiencing an outward pull (because,
centrifugal force is greater than the resultant
force towards the centre). A force measuring
instrument can record it as well.
On reaching the uniform speed, in the
frame of reference of merry-go-round, this
centrifugal force exactly balances the resultant
of all the real forces. The resultant force in
that frame of reference is thus zero. Thus, only
in such a frame of reference we can say that
the centrifugal force balances the centripetal
force. It must be remembered that in this case,
centrifugal force means the ‘net pseudo force’
and centripetal force means the ‘resultant of
all the real forces’.
There are two ways of writing force
equation for a circular motion:

Resultant force  m 2 r
or


Remember this
(i) The word centripetal is NOT the name
or type of that force (like gravitational
force, nuclear force, etc). It is the
adjective or property of that force
saying that the direction of this force
is along the radius and towards centre
(centre seeking).
(ii) While performing circular or rotational
motion, the resultant of all the real
forces acting upon the body is (or, must
be) towards the centre, hence we call
this resultant force to be centripetal
force. Under the action of this resultant
force, the direction of the velocity is
always maintained tangential to the
circular track.
			
The vice versa need not be true,
i.e., the resultant force directed towards
the centre may not always result into a
circular motion. (In the Chapter 7 you
will know that during an s.h.m. also the
force is always directed to the centre of
the motion). For a motion to be circular,
correspondingly matching tangential
velocity is also essential.
(iii) Obviously, this discussion is in an
inertial frame of reference in which
we are observing that the body is
performing a circular motion.

ii) Centrifugal force (c.f.f.):
Visualize yourself on a merry-go-round
rotating uniformly. If you close your eyes, you
will not know that you are performing a circular
motion but you will feel that you are at rest. In
order to explain that you are at rest, you need
to consider a force equal in magnitude to the
resultant real force, but directed opposite, i.e.,
2
away from the centre. This force,  m r is
the centrifugal (away from the centre) force. It
is a pseudo force arising due to the centripetal
acceleration of the frame of reference.



Activity
Attach a suitable mass to spring balance so
that it stretches by about half is capacity.
Now whirl the spring balance so that the
mass performs a horizontal motion. You will
notice that the balance now reads more mass
for the same mass. Can you explain this?
1.3 Applications of Uniform Circular Motion:
1.3.1 Vehicle Along a Horizontal Circular
Track:
Figure 1.4 shows vertical section of a car
on a horizontal circular track of radius r. Plane
of figure is a vertical plane, perpendicular to
the track but includes only centre C of the
track. Forces acting on the car (considered
to be a particle) are (i) weight mg, vertically
downwards, (ii) normal reaction N, vertically
upwards that balances the weight mg and (iii)

tyres. This is static friction because it prevents
the vehicle from outward slipping or skidding.
This is the resultant force which is centripetal.

but above it. Thus, the frictional force
and the centrifugal force result into a
torque which may topple the vehicle
(even a two wheeler).
(ii) For a two wheeler, it is a must for
the rider to incline with respect to the
vertical to prevent toppling.
Use your brain power
(I) Obtain the condition for not toppling
for a four-wheeler. On what factors
does it depend, and in what way? Think
about the normal reactions – where are
those and how much are those! What
is the recommendation on loading the
vehicle for not toppling easily? If a
vehicle topples while turning, which
wheels leave the contact? Why? How
does it affect the tyres? What is the
recommendation for this?
(II) Determine the angle to be made with
the vertical by a two wheeler rider while
turning on a horizontal track.
Hint: For both (I) and (II) above, find the
torque that balances the torque due
to centrifugal force and torque due to
static friction force.
(III)We have mentioned about static friction
between road and the tyres. Why is it
static? What about the kinetic friction
between road and the tyres?
(IV) What do you do if your vehicle is
trapped on a slippery or a sandy road?
What is the physics involved?

For a given track, radius r is constant. For

speed v increases, the force of static friction fs
also increases. However, fs has an upper limit

static friction between road and tyres of the
vehicle. This imposes an upper limit to the

(i) In the discussion till now, we had
assumed the vehicle to be a point.
In reality, if it is a four wheeler, the
resultant normal reaction is due to all
the four tyres. Normal reactions at all
the four tyres are never equal while
undergoing circular motion. Also, the
centrifugal force acts through the centre
of mass, which is not at the ground level,

1.3.2 Well (or Wall) of Death: (मौत का कुआँ):
This is a vertical cylindrical wall of radius
r inside which a vehicle is driven in horizontal
circles. This can be seen while performing
stunts.
As shown in the Fig. 1.5, the forces acting
on the vehicle (assumed to be a point) are (i)
Normal reaction N acting horizontally and

due to the weight. What about a fourwheeler?
(iv) In this case, the angle made by the road
surface with the horizontal is 90°, i.e., if
the road is banked at 90°, it imposes a
lower limit on the turning speed. In the
previous sub-section we saw that for an
unbanked (banking angle 0) road there
is an upper limit for the turning speed.
It means that for any other banking
angle (0 < θ < 90°), the turning speed
will have the upper as well as the lower
limit.

towards the centre, (ii) Weight mg acting
vertically downwards, and (iii) Force of static
friction fs acting vertically upwards between
vertical wall and the tyres. It is static friction
because it has to prevent the downward
slipping. Its magnitude is equal to mg, as this
is the only upward force.
Normal reaction N is thus the resultant
centripetal force (or the only force that can
balance the centrifugal force). Thus, in

1.3.3 Vehicle on a Banked Road:
As seen earlier, while taking a turn on
a horizontal road, the force of static friction
between the tyres of the vehicle and the road
provides the necessary centripetal force (or
balances the centrifugal force). However, the
frictional force is having an upper limit. Also,
its value is usually not constant as the road
surface is not uniform. Thus, in real life, we
should not depend upon it, as far as possible.
For this purpose, the surfaces of curved roads
are tilted with the horizontal with some angle
θ . This is called banking of a road or the road
is said to be banked.
Figure 1.6 Shows the vertical section of
a vehicle on a curved road of radius r banked

(ii) In this case, fs = isN is valid only for the

(iii) During the derivation, the vehicle is
assumed to be a particle. In reality, it
is not so. During revolutions in such
a well, a two-wheeler rider is never
horizontal, else, the torque due to her/
his weight will topple her/him. Think

are (i) weight mg acting vertically downwards
and (ii) normal reaction N acting perpendicular
to the road. As seen above, only at this speed,
the resultant of these two forces (which is
Nsin θ ) is the necessary centripetal force (or
balances the centrifugal force). In practice,
vehicles never travel exactly with this speed.
For speeds other than this, the component of
force of static friction between road and the
tyres helps us, up to a certain limit.

at an angle θ with the horizontal. Considering
the vehicle to be a point and ignoring friction
(not eliminating) and other non-conservative
forces like air resistance, there are two forces
acting on the vehicle, (i) weight mg, vertically
downwards and (ii) normal reaction N,
perpendicular to the surface of the road. As
the motion of the vehicle is along a horizontal
circle, the resultant force must be horizontal
and directed towards the centre of the track. It
means, the vertical force mg must be balanced.
Thus, we have to resolve the normal reaction
N along the vertical and along the horizontal.
Its vertical component Ncos θ balances weight
mg. Horizontal component Nsin θ being
the resultant force, must be the necessary
centripetal force (or balance the centrifugal
force). Thus, in magnitude,

We can also revolve the string in such a

point object performs a (practically) uniform

Thus, both period and frequency
depend upon θ .
(ii) During revolutions, the string can
NEVER become horizontal. This can
be explained in two different ways.
(a) If the string becomes horizontal,
the force due to tension will also be
horizontal. Its vertical component will
then be zero. In this case, nothing will
be there to balance mg.
(b) For horizontal string, i = 90°. This will
indicate the frequency to be infinite
and the period to be zero, which are
impossible. Also, in this case, the tension

Figure 1.9 shows the vertical section of
a conical pendulum having bob (point mass)
of mass m and string of length L. In a given
position B, the forces acting on the bob are (i)
its weight mg directed vertically downwards
and (ii) the force T0 due to the tension in the
string, directed along the string, towards
the support A. As the motion of the bob is a
horizontal circular motion, the resultant force
must be horizontal and directed towards the
centre C of the circular motion. For this, all
the vertical forces must cancel. Hence, we
shall resolve the force T0 due to the tension.
If θ is the angle made by the string with the
vertical, at any position (semi-vertical angle
of the cone), the vertical component T0 cos
θ balances the weight mg. The horizontal
component T0 sinθ then becomes the resultant
force which is centripetal.

1.4 Vertical Circular Motion:
Two types of vertical circular motions are
commonly observed in practice:
(a) A controlled vertical circular motion such
as a giant wheel or similar games. In this
case the speed is either kept constant or
NOT totally controlled by gravity.
(b) Vertical circular motion controlled only
by gravity. In this case, we initially
supply the necessary energy (mostly) at
the lowest point. Then onwards, the entire
kinetics is governed by the gravitational
force. During the motion, there is
interconversion of kinetic energy and
gravitational potential energy.

inextensible and flexible string. It is whirled
along a vertical circle so that the bob performs
a vertical circular motion and the string rotates
in a vertical plane. At any position of the bob,
there are only two forces acting on the bob:

1.4.2 Sphere of Death (मृत्‍यु गोल):
This is a popular show in a circus. During
this, two-wheeler rider (or riders) undergo
rounds inside a hollow sphere. Starting with
small horizontal circles, they eventually
perform revolutions along vertical circles. The
dynamics of this vertical circular motion is
the same as that of the point mass tied to the
string, except that the force due to tension T is
replaced by the normal reaction force N.
If you have seen this show, try to visualize
that initially there are nearly horizontal circles.
The linear speed is more for larger circles but
angular speed (frequency) is more for smaller
circles (while starting or stopping). This is as
per the theory of conical pendulum.
1.4.3 Vehicle at the Top of a Convex OverBridge:

Remember this
1. Equation (1.15) is independent of v and r.
2. TA can never be exactly equal to zero in
the case of a string, else, the string will
slack. ∴ TB > 6 mg.
3. None of the parameters (including the
linear and angular accelerations) are
constant during such a motion. Obviously,
kinematical equations given in the table1
are not applicable.
4. We can determine the position vector or
velocity at any instant using the energy
conservation. But as the function of the
radius vector is not integrable (definite
integration is not possible), theoretically
it is not possible to determine the period
or frequency. However, experimentally
the period can be measured.
5. Equations (1.10) and (1.13) give only
the respective minimum speeds at the
uppermost and the lowermost points. Any
higher speeds obeying the equation (1.14)
are allowed.
6. In reality, we have to continuously
supply some energy to overcome the air
resistance.

Fig. 1.11: Vehicle on a convex over-bridge.

Case II: Mass tied to a rod: Consider a bob
(point mass) tied to a (practically massless and
rigid) rod and whirled along a vertical circle.
The basic difference between the rod and the
string is that the string needs some tension at
all the points, including the uppermost point.
Thus, a certain minimum speed, Eq. (1.10), is
necessary at the uppermost point in the case
of a string. In the case of a rod, as the rod is
rigid, such a condition is not necessary. Thus
(practically) zero speed is possible at the
uppermost point.
Using similar mathematics, it is left to the
readers to show that

Figure shows a vehicle at the top of a
convex over bridge, during its motion (part

the vehicle are (a) Weight mg and (b) Normal
reaction force N, both along the vertical line
(topmost position). The resultant of these two
must provide the necessary centripetal force

uppermost position. Thus, if v is the speed at

It is clear that the moment of inertia of an
object depends upon (i) individual masses and
(ii) the distribution of these masses about the
given axis of rotation. For a different axis, it
will again depend upon the mass distribution
around that axis and will be different if there is
no symmetry.
During this discussion, for simplicity, we
assumed the object to be consisting of a finite
number of particles. In practice, usually, it
is not so. For a homogeneous rigid object of
mathematically integrable mass distribution,
the moment of inertia is to be obtained by
integration as I  r 2 dm . If integrable mass
distribution is not known, it is not possible to
obtain the moment of inertia theoretically, but
it can be determined experimentally.

needed for this depend not only upon the mass
of the door, but also upon the (perpendicular)
distance from the axis of rotation, where we
apply the force. Thus, the quantity analogous
to mass includes not only the mass, but also
takes care of the distance wise distribution of
the mass around the axis of rotation. To know
the exact relation, let us derive an expression
for the rotational kinetic energy which is the
sum of the translational kinetic energies of all
the individual particles.

1.5.1 Moment of Inertia of a Uniform Ring:
An object is called a uniform ring if
its mass is (practically) situated uniformly
on the circumference of a circle (Fig 1.13).
Obviously, it is a two dimensional object of
negligible thickness. If it is rotating about its
own axis (line perpendicular to its plane and
passing through its centre), its entire mass M
is practically at a distance equal to its radius
R form the axis. Hence, the expression for the
moment of inertia of a uniform ring of mass M
and radius R is I = MR2.

1.5.2 Moment of Inertia of a Uniform Disc:
Disc is a two dimensional circular object
of negligible thickness. It is said to be uniform
if its mass per unit area and its composition is
the same throughout. The ratio   m  mass
A area
is called the surface density.

of inertias of objects of several integrable
geometrical shapes can be derived. Some of
those are given in the Table 3 at the end of the
topic.
1.6 Radius of Gyration:
As stated earlier, theoretical calculation
of moment of inertia is possible only for
mathematically integrable geometrical shapes.
However, experimentally we can determine
the moment of inertia of any object. It depends
upon mass of that object and how that mass
is distributed from or around the given axis
of rotation. If we are interested in knowing
only the mass distribution around the axis of
rotation, we can express moment of inertia
of any object as I = MK 2 , where M is mass
of that object. It means that the mass of that
object is effectively at a distance K from the
given axis of rotation. In this case, K is defined
as the radius of gyration of the object about
the given axis of rotation. In other words, if K
is radius of gyration for an object, I = MK 2 is
the moment of inertia of that object. Larger the
value of K, farther is the mass from the axis.

Consider a uniform disc of mass M and
radius R rotating about its own axis, which is
the line perpendicular to its plane and passing
M
through its centre  
.
 R2
As it is a uniform circular object, it can
be considered to be consisting of a number
of concentric rings of radii increasing from
(practically) zero to R. One of such rings of
mass dm is shown by shaded portion in the
Fig. 1.14.

Fig .1.14: Moment of Inertia of a disk.

Width of this ring is dr, which is so small
that the entire ring can be considered to be
of average radius r. (In practical sense, dr is
less than the least count of the instrument that
measures r, so that r is constant for that ring).
dm
 

Area of this ring is A = 2πr.dr 
2 r .dr
∴ dm = 2πσr.dr.
As it is a ring, this entire mass is at a
distance r from the axis of rotation. Thus, the
moment of inertia of this ring is Ir = dm (r2)
Moment of inertia (I) of the disc can now
be obtained by integrating Ir from r = 0 to
r = R. R

Consider a uniform ring and a uniform
disc, both of the same mass M and same
radius R. Let Ir and Id be their respective
moment of inertias.
If Kr and Kd are their respective radii
of gyration, we can write,
2
Ir = MR2 = MK r ∴Kr = R and
R

Id = MR2 = MK d ∴ Kd =

It shows mathematically that K is
decided by the distribution of mass. In a
ring the entire mass is distributed at the
distance R, while for a disc, its mass is
distributed between 0 and R. Among any
objects of same mass and radius, ring has
the largest radius of gyration and hence
maximum M.I.

regular geometrical shapes given in the table 3
are about their axes of symmetry. These are
derived by integration. However, every time
the axis need not be the axis of symmetry. In
simple transformations it may be parallel or
perpendicular to the symmetrical axis. For
example, if a rod is rotated about one of its
ends, the axis is parallel to its axis of symmetry.
If a disc or a ring is rotated about its diameter,
the axis is perpendicular to the central axis.
In such cases, simple transformations are
possible in the expressions of moment of
inertias. These are called theorem of parallel
axes and theorem of perpendicular axes.
1.7.1 Theorem of Parallel Axes:
In order to apply this theorem to any
object, we need two axes parallel to each other
with one of them passing through the centre of
mass of the object.

It states that, “The moment of inertia (IO)
of an object about any axis is the sum of its
moment of inertia (IC) about an axis parallel to
the given axis, and passing through the centre
of mass and the product of the mass of the
object and the square of the distance between
the two axes (Mh2).”

In Fig. 1.15, the point D is chosen such that
we have to extend OC for the perpendicular
DN to fall on it. What will happen to the final
expression of I0, if point D is so chosen that
the perpendicular DN falls directly on OC?
1.7.2 Theorem of Perpendicular Axes:
This theorem relates the moment of
inertias of a laminar object about three
mutually perpendicular and concurrent axes,
two of them in the plane of the object and
the third perpendicular to the object. Laminar
object is like a leaf, or any two dimensional
object, e.g., a ring, a disc, any plane sheet, etc.

Figure 1.15 shows an object of mass M.
Axis MOP is any axis passing through point
O. Axis ACB is passing through the centre
of mass C of the object, parallel to the axis
MOP, and at a distance h from it (∴ h = CO).
Consider a mass element dm located at point

Figure 1.16 shows a rigid laminar object able
to rotate about three mutually perpendicular
axes x, y and z. Axes x and y are in the plane
of the object while the z axis is perpendicular
to it, and all are concurrent at O. Consider a
mass element dm located at any point P. PM
= y and PN = x are the perpendiculars drown
from P respectively on the x and y axes. The
respective perpendicular distances of point
M from x, y and z axes will then be y, x and
 y 2 + x 2 . If Ix, Iy and Iz are the respective
moment of inertias of the body about x, y and

(II) Consider any two mutually perpendicular
diameters x and y of the flywheel. If the
flywheel rotates about these diameters, these
three axes (own axis and two diameters) will
be mutually perpendicular and concurrent.
Thus, perpendicular axes theorem is

As the diameter passes through the centre
of mass of the (uniform) disc, I d = I C
Consider a tangent in the plane of the disc
and parallel to this diameter. It is at the
distance h = R from the diameter. Thus,

expression p = mv of linear momentum, if the

1.8.1 Expression for Angular Momentum in
Terms of Moment of Inertia:
Figure 1.12 in the section 1.5 shows a
rigid object rotating with a constant angular
speed ω about an axis perpendicular to the
plane of paper. For theoretical simplification
let us consider the object to be consisting of
N number of particles of masses m1, m2, …..
mN at respective perpendicular distances r1, r2,
…..rN from the axis of rotation. As the object
rotates, all these particles perform UCM with
same angular speed ω , but with different linear
speeds v1 = r1 ω , v2 = r2 ω , ..... vN = rN ω . 
Directions of individual velocities v1 ,

v 2 , etc., are along the tangents to their
respective tracks. Linear momentum of the
first particle is of magnitude p1 = m1v1 = m1r1 ω .

Its direction is along that of v1 .

For a rigid body with a fixed axis of
rotation, all these angular momenta are directed
along the axis of rotation, and this direction
can be obtained by using right hand thumb
rule. As all of them have the same direction,
their magnitudes can be algebraically added.
Thus, magnitude of angular momentum of the

Examples of conservation of angular
momentum: During some shows of ballet
dance, acrobat in a circus, sports like ice
skating, diving in a swimming pool, etc., the
principle of conservation of angular momentum
is realized. In all these applications the product
L  I   I  2 n  is constant (once the players
acquire a certain speed). Thus, if the moment
of inertia I is increased, the angular speed and
hence the frequency of revolution n decreases.
Also, if the moment of inertia is decreased, the
frequency increases.
(i) Ballet dancers: During ice ballet, the
dancers have to undertake rounds of smaller
and larger radii. The dancers come together
while taking the rounds of smaller radius (near
the centre). In this case, the moment of inertia
of their system becomes minimum and the
frequency increases, to make it thrilling. While
outer rounds, the dancers outstretch their legs
and arms. This increases their moment of
inertia that reduces the angular speed and
hence the linear speed. This is essential to
prevent slipping.
(ii) Diving in a swimming pool (during
competition): While on the diving board, the
divers stretch their body so as to increase the
moment of inertia. Immediately after leaving
the board, they fold their body. This reduces
the moment inertia considerably. As a result,
the frequency increases and they can complete
more rounds in air to make the show attractive.
Again, while entering into water they stretch
their body into a streamline shape. This allows
them a smooth entry into the water.

The relation   I  is analogous to

1.10 Conservation of Angular Momentum:
In the article 4.7 of XIth Std. we have
seen the conservation of linear momentum
which says that linear momentum of an
isolated system is conserved in the absence
of an external unbalanced force. As seen
earlier, torque and angular momentum are
the respective analogous quantities to force
and linear momentum in rotational dynamics.
With suitable changes this can be transformed
into the conservation of angular momentum.
As seen in the section 1.8, angular
momentum or the moment of linear momentum
  
of a system is given by L  r  p

where r is the position vector from the axis of

It must be remembered that static friction
is essential for a purely rolling motion. In this
case, it prevents the sliding motion. You might
have noticed that many a times while rolling
down, the motion is initially a purely rolling
motion that later on turns out to be a sliding
motion. Similarly, if you push a sphere-like
object along a horizontal surface, initially it
slips for some distance and then starts rolling.
1.11.1 Linear Acceleration and Speed While
Pure Rolling Down an Inclined Plane:
Figure 1.18 shows a rigid object of mass

1.11 Rolling Motion:
The objects like a cylinder, sphere,
wheels, etc. are quite often seen to perform
rolling motion. In the case of pure rolling,
two motions are undertaking simultaneously;
circular motion and linear motion. Individual
motion of the particles (except the one at the
centre of mass) is too difficult to describe.
However, for theory considerations we can
consider the actual motion to be the result of
(i) circular motion of the body as a whole,
about its own symmetric axis and
(ii) linear motion of the body assuming it to
be concentrated at its centre of mass. In other
words, the centre of mass performs purely
translational motion.

A fluid flows under the action of a force
or a pressure gradient. Behaviour of a fluid
in motion is normally complicated. We can
understand fluids by making some simple
assumptions. We introduce the concept of an
ideal fluid to understand its behaviour. An
ideal fluid has the following properties:
1. It is incompressible: its density is constant.
2. Its flow is irrotational: its flow is smooth,
there are no turbulences in the flow.
3. It is nonviscous: there is no internal friction
in the flow, i.e., the fluid has no viscosity.
(viscosity is discussed in section 2.6.1)
4. Its flow is steady: its velocity at each point
is constant in time.
It is important to understand the difference
between a solid and a fluid. Solids can be
subjected to shear stress (tangential stress) as
shown in Fig. 2.1 and normal stress, as shown
in Fig.2.2.

Can you recall?
1. How important are fluids in our life?
2. What is atmospheric pressure?
3. Do you feel excess pressure while
swimming under water? Why?
2.1 Introduction:
In XIth Std. we discussed the behaviour of
solids under the action of a force. Among three
states of matter, i.e., solid, liquid and gas, a
solid nearly maintains its fixed shape and
volume even if a large force is applied to it.
Liquids and gases do not have their own shape
and they take the shape of the containing
vessel. Due to this, liquids and gases flow under
the action of external force. A fluid means a
substance that can flow. Therefore, liquids and
gases, collectively, are called fluids. A fluid
either has no rigidity or its rigidity is very low.
In our daily life, we often experience
the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest and in
motion. Viscosity and surface tension play
an important role in nature. We will try to
understand such properties in this chapter.
2.2 Fluid:
Any substance that can flow is a
fluid. A fluid is a substance that deforms
continually under the action of an external
force. Fluid is a phase of matter that
includes liquids, gases and plasmas.

Fig. 2.1: Shear stress.

Do you know?
Plasma is one of the four fundamental states
of matter. It consists of a gas of ions, free
electrons and neutral atoms.

(a) Compressive 		

(b) Tensile

Fig. 2.2: Normal stress.

Solids oppose the shear stress either by
developing a restoring force, which means that
the deformations are reversible, or they require
a certain initial stress before they deform and
start flowing. (We have studied this behavior
of solids (elastic behaviour) in XIth Std).
Ideal fluids, on the other hand, can only
be subjected to normal, compressive stress
(called pressure). Most fluids offer a very

We shall discuss mechanical properties
of only liquids and gases in this Chapter. The
shear modulus of a fluid is zero. In simpler
words, fluids are substances which cannot
resist any shear force applied to them. Air,
water, flour dough, toothpaste, etc., are some
common examples of fluids. Molten lava is
also a fluid.
26

weak resistance to deformation. Real fluids
display viscosity and so are capable of being
subjected to low levels of shear stress.

Figure 2.4 shows a fluid exerting normal
force on a vertical surface and Fig. 2.5 shows
fluid exerting normal force on a horizontal
surface.

Fig. 2.3: Forces acting on a small surface dA
within a fluid at rest.

Fig. 2.4: Fluid exert force on vertical surface.

The Fig. 2.3 shows a small surface of
area dA at rest within a fluid. The surface does
not accelerate, so the surrounding fluid exerts
equal normal forces dF on both sides of it.
Properties of Fluids:
1. They do not oppose deformation, they get
permanently deformed.
2. They have ability to flow.
3. They have ability to take the shape of the
container.
A fluid exhibits these properties because
it cannot oppose a shear stress when in
static equilibrium.

Fig. 2.5: Fluid exert force on horizontal surface.

Thus, an object having small weight
can exert high pressure if its weight acts on a
small surface area. For example, a force of
10 N acting on 1 cm2 results in a pressure of
105 N m-2. On the other hand, the same force of
10 N while acting on an area of 1 m2, exerts a
pressure of only 10 N m-2.

Remember this
Remember this

The term fluid includes both the liquid and gas
phases. It is commonly used, as a synonym
for liquid only, without any reference to gas.
For example, ‘brake fluid’ is hydraulic oil
and will not perform its required function if
there is gas in it! This colloquial use of the
term is also common in the fields of medicine
and nutrition, e.g., “take plenty of fluids”.

1 N weight is about 100 g mass, if
g =10 m s-2.
The SI unit of pressure is N/m2. Also,
1 N/m2 = 1 Pascal (Pa). The dimension of
pressure is [L-1M1T-2]. Pressure is a scalar
quantity. Other common units of measuring
pressure of a gas are bar and torr.
1 bar = 105 Nm-2
1 hectapascal (hPa) = 100 Pa

2.2.1 Fluids at Rest:
The branch of physics which deals
with the properties of fluids at rest is called
hydrostatics. In the next few sections we will
consider some of the properties of fluids at rest.
2.3 Pressure:
A fluid at rest exerts a force on the surface
of contact. The surface may be a wall or the
bottom of an open container of the fluid. The
normal force (F) exerted by a fluid at rest per
unit surface area (A) of contact is called the
pressure (p) of the fluid.

27

Remember this

Remember this

The concept of pressure is useful in dealing
with fluids, i.e., liquids and gases. As fluids
do not have definite shape and volume, it
is convenient to use the quantities pressure
and density rather than force and mass when
studying hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.

1. As p = hρg, the pressure exerted by a
fluid at rest is independent of the shape
and size of the container.
2. p = hρg is true for liquids as well as for
gases.
Example 2.1: Two different liquids of
density ρ1 and ρ2 exert the same pressure at
a certain point. What will be the ratio of the
heights of the respective liquid columns?
Solution: Let h1 be the height of the liquid of
density ρ1. Then the pressure exerted by the
liquid of density ρ1 is p1 = h1ρ1g. Similarly,
let h2 be the height of the liquid of density
ρ2. Then the pressure exerted by the liquid
of density ρ2 is p2 = h2ρ2g.
Both liquids exert the same pressure,
therefore we write,
p1 = p2
h1  2

h
ρ
g
=
h

or,
∴ 1 1
2 2
h2 1
Alternate method:
For a given value of p = hρg = constant,
as g is constant. So the hight is inversely
proportional to the density of the fluid ρ. In
this case, since pressure is constant, height
is inversely proportional to density of the
liquid.
Example 2.2: A swimmer is swimming in
a swimming pool at 6 m below the surface
of the water. Calculate the pressure on the
swimmer due to water above. (Density of
water = 1000 kg/m3, g = 9.8 m/s2)
Solution: Given,
h = 6 m, ρ = 1000 kg/m3, g = 9.8 m/s2
p = hρg = 6 × 1000 × 9.8 = 5.88 × 105 N/m2
(Which is nearly 6 times the atmospheric
pressure!)

2.3.1 Pressure Due to a Liquid Column:

Fig. 2.6: Pressure due to a liquid column.

A vessel is filled with a liquid. Let us
calculate the pressure exerted by an imaginary
cylinder of cross sectional area A inside the
container. Let the density of the fluid be ρ, and
the height of the imaginary cylinder be h as
shown in the Fig. 2.6. The liquid column exerts
a force F = mg, which is its weight, on the
bottom of the cylinder. This force acts in the
downward direction. Therefore, the pressure p
exerted by the liquid column on the bottom of
cylinder is,
F
p=

mg
∴ p=
A
Now, m = (volume of cylinder) x (density of
liquid)
= (Ah) × ρ = Ahρ
 Ah  g
 p
A
p = hρg 			
--- (2.2)
Thus, the pressure p due to a liquid of
density ρ at rest, and at a depth h below the
free surface is hρg.
Note that the pressure dose not depend
on the area of the imaginary cylinder used to
derive the expression.

2.3.2 Atmospheric Pressure:
Earth's atmosphere is made up of a fluid,
namely, air. It exerts a downward force due
to its weight. The pressure due to this force
is called atmospheric pressure. Thus, at any
point, the atmospheric pressure is the weight
of a column of air of unit cross section starting
28

from that point and extending to the top of the
atmosphere. Clearly, the atmospheric pressure
is highest at the surface of the Earth, i.e., at the
sea level, and decreases as we go above the
surface as the height of the column of air above
decreases. The atmospheric pressure at sea
level is called normal atmospheric pressure.
The density of air in the atmosphere decreases
with increase in height and becomes negligible
beyond a height of about 8 km so that the
height of air column producing atmospheric
pressure at sea level can be taken to be 8 km.
The region where gas pressure is less than
the atmospheric pressure is called vacuum.
Perfect or absolute vacuum is when no matter,
i.e., no atoms or molecules are present.
Usually, vacuum refers to conditions when the
gas pressure is considerably smaller than the
atmospheric pressure.
2.3.3 Absolute Pressure and Gauge Pressure:
Consider a tank filled with water as shown
in Fig. 2.7. Assume an imaginary cylinder of
horizontal base area A and height x1- x2 = h.
x1 and x2 being the heights measured from a
reference point, height increasing upwards:
x1 > x2. The vertical forces acting on the
cylinder are:


1. Force F1 acts downwards at the top surface
of the cylinder, and is due to the weight of
the water
 column above the cylinder.
2. Force F2 acts upwards at the bottom
surface of the cylinder, and is due to the
water below the cylinder.
3. The gravitational force on the water
enclosed in the cylinder is mg, where m is
the mass of the water in the cylinder. As
the water is in static equilibrium, the forces
on the cylinder are balanced. The balance
of these forces in magnitude is written as,
F2= F1+ mg 			
--- (2.3)
p1and p2 are the pressures at the top and
bottom surfaces of the cylinder respectively
due to the fluid. Using Eq. (2.1) we can write
F1 = p1A, and F2 = p2A
--- (2.4)
Also, the mass m of the water in the cylinder
can be written as,
m = density × volume = ρV
--- (2.5)
∴m = ρA(x1-x2)		

Substituting Eq. (2.4) and Eq. (2.5) in Eq. (2.3)
we get,
p2A = p1A + ρAg (x1- x2)
p2 = p1 + ρg (x1- x2) 		
--- (2.6)
This equation can be used to find the
pressure inside a liquid (as a function of
depth below the liquid surface) and also the
atmospheric pressure (as a function of altitude
or height above the sea level).

Fig. 2.7: Pressure due to an imaginary cylinder
of fluid.

To find the pressure p at a depth h below
the liquid surface, let the top of an imaginary
cylinder be at the surface of the liquid. Let
this level be x1. Let x2 be some point at depth h
below the surface as shown in Fig. 2.8. Let p0
be the atmospheric pressure at the surface, i.e.,
at x1. Then, substituting x1 = 0, p1 = p0, x2 = -h,
and p2 = p in Eq. (2.6) we get,
p = p0+ hρg 			
--- (2.7)
The above equation gives the total
pressure, or the absolute pressure p, at a depth
h below the surface of the liquid. The total
pressure p, at the depth h is the sum of:
1. p0, the pressure due to the atmosphere,
which acts on the surface of the
liquid, and
2. hρg, the pressure due to the liquid at depth
h.

Fig. 2.8. Pressure at a depth h below the surface
of a liquid.

base of the vessel B and the liquid from vessel
C would rise into the vessel B. However,
it is never observed. Equation 2.2 tells that
the pressure at a point depends only on the
height of the liquid column above it. It does
not depend on the shape of the vessel. In this
case, height of the liquid column is the same
for all the vessels. Therefore, the pressure of
liquid column in each vessel is the same and
the system is in equilibrium. That means the
liquid in vessel C does not rise in to vessel B.

In general, the difference between the
absolute pressure and the atmospheric pressure
is called the gauge pressure. Using Eq. (2.7),
gauge pressure at depth h below the liquid
surface can be written as,
p - p0 = hρg			
--- (2.8)
Eq. (2.8) is also applicable to levels above
the liquid surface. It gives the pressure at a
given height above a liquid surface, in terms
of the atmospheric pressure p0 (assuming that
the atmospheric density is uniform up to that
height).
To find the atmospheric pressure at a
distance d above the liquid surface as shown
in Fig. 2.9, we substitute x1 = d, p1 = p, x2 = 0,
p2 = p0 and ρ = ρair in Eq. (2.6) we get,
p = po - dρair g 		--- (2.9)

Fig. 2.10: Hydrostatic paradox.

Consider Fig. 2.10 (b). The arrows indicate
the forces exerted against the liquid by the walls
of the vessel. These forces are perpendicular to
walls of the vessel at each point. These forces
can be resolved into vertical and horizontal
components. The vertical components act in
the upward direction. Weight of the liquid in
section B is not balanced and contibutes the
pressure at the base. Thus, it is no longer a
paradox!
2.3.5 Pascal’s Law:
Pascal’s law states that the pressure
applied at any point of an enclosed fluid at
rest is transmitted equally and undiminished to
every point of the fluid and also on the walls of
the container, provided the effect of gravity is
neglected.

and a/2 respectively. If a force F is applied
on the piston A, the pressure exerted on the
liquid is p = F/a. It is observed that the other
three pistons B, C, and D move outward.
In order to keep these three pistons B, C,

poured in any one of the vessels, it is noticed
that the level of liquids in all the vessels is the
same. This observation is somewhat puzzling.
It was called 'hydrostatics paradox' before
the principle of hydrostatics were completely
understood.
One can feel that the pressure of the base
of the vessel C would be more than that at the

on it.

Thus, F2 is much larger than F1. A heavy
load can be placed on S2 and can be lifted up

S1. This is the principle of a hydraulic lift.

ii) Hydraulic brakes: Hydraulic brakes are
used to slow down or stop vehicles in motion.
It is based on the same principle as that of a
hydraulic lift.
Figure 2.12 shows schematic diagram
of a hydraulic brake system. By pressing the
brake pedal, the piston of the master cylinder
is pushed in forward direction. As a result,
the piston in the slave cylinder which has a
much larger area of cross section as compared
to that of the master cylinder, also moves in
forward direction so as to maintain the volume
of the oil constant. The slave piston pushes the
friction pads against the rotating disc, which
is connected to the wheel. Thus, causing a
moving vehicle to slow down or stop.

i.e. pB = pC = pD = p, this indicates that the
pressure applied on piston A is transmitted
equally and undiminished to all parts of the
fluid and the walls of the vessel.
Applications of Pascal’s Law:
i) Hydraulic lift: Hydraulic lift is used to lift a
heavy object using a small force. The working
of this machine is based on Pascal’s law.

Fig. 2.11 Hydraulic Lift.

As shown in Fig. 2.11, a tank containing
a fluid is fitted with two pistons S1 and S2 . S1
has a smaller area of cross section, A1 while
S2 has a much larger area of cross section,
A2 (A2 >> A1). If we apply a force F1 on the
smaller piston S1 in the downward direction it
will generate pressure p = (F1/A1) which will be

The master cylinder has a smaller area of
cross section A1 compared to the area A2 of the
slave cylinder. By applying a small force F1

i) Mercury Barometer: An instrument that
measures atmospheric pressure is called a
barometer. One of the first barometers was by
Italian scientist Torricelli. The barometer is
in the form of a glass tube completely filled
with mercury and placed upside down in a
small dish containing mercury. Its schematic
diagram is shown in Fig. 2.13.

to the master cylinder, we generate pressure
p = (F1/A1). This pressure is transmitted
undiminished throughout the system. The force
F2 on slave cylinder is then,

 A1 
This is similar to the principle used in
hydraulic lift. Since area A2 is greater than A1,
F2 is also greater than F1. Thus, a small force
applied on the brake pedal gets converted into
large force and slows down or stops a moving
vehicle.
Example 2.3: A hydraulic brake system
of a car of mass 1000 kg having speed of
50 km/h, has a cylindrical piston of radius
of 0.5 cm. The slave cylinder has a radius
of 2.5 cm. If a constant force of 100 N is
applied on the brake what distance the car
will travel before coming to stop?
Solution: Given,
F1 = 100 N, A1 = π (0.5 × 10-2)2 m2,
A2 = π (2.5 × 10-2)2 m2, F2 = ?

Fig. 2.13: Mercury
barometer.

1. A glass tube of about 1 meter length and
a diameter of about 1 cm is filled with
mercury up to its brim. It is then quickly
inverted into a small dish containing
mercury. The level of mercury in the glass
tube lowers as some mercury spills in the
dish. A gap is created between the surface
of mercury in the glass tube and the closed
end of the glass tube. The gap does not
contain any air and it is called Torricelli’s
vacuum. It dose contain some mercury
vapors.
2. Thus, the pressure at the upper end of the
mercury column inside the tube is zero, i.e.
pressure at point such as A is pA= zero.
3. Let us consider a point C on the mercury
surface in the dish and another point B
inside the tube at the same horizontal level
as that of the point C.
4. The pressure at C is equal to the
atmospheric pressure p0 because it is open
to atmosphere. As points B and C are at the
same horizontal level, the pressure at B is
also equal to the atmospheric pressure po,
i.e. pB= po.
5. Suppose the point B is at a depth h below
the point A and ρ is the density of mercury
then,
PB= PA + hρg 			--- (2.11)

­2.3.6 Measurement of Pressure:
Instruments used to measure pressure are
called pressure meters or pressure gauges or
vacuum gauges. Below we will describe two
instruments which are commonly used to
measure pressure.
Caution:
Use of mercury is not advised in a
laboratory because mercury vapours are
hazardous for life and for environment.
32

pressure at C is the same as at D, i.e., inside
the chamber. Therefore, the pressure p in the
container is,
p = pC				
Using Eq. (2.12) and Eq. (2.13) we can write,
p = p0 + hρg			--- (2.14)
As the manometer measures the gauge
pressure of the gas in the container D, we can
write the gauge pressure in the container D as
p - p0 = hρg

pA = 0 (there is vacuum above point A) and
pB = p0, therefore, p0 = hρg, where h is the length
of mercury column in the mercury barometer.
Remember this
The atmospheric pressure is generally
expressed as the length of mercury column
in a mercury barometer.
patm = 76 cm of Hg = 760 mm of Hg
Another unit for measuring pressure is
torr. One torr = 1 mm of Hg

Can you recall?

Can you tell?

1. You must have blown soap bubbles in
your childhood. What is their shape?
2. Why does a greased razor blade float
on the surface of water?
3. Why can a water spider walk
comfortably on the surface of still
water?
4. Why are free liquid drops and bubbles
always spherical in shape?

What will be the normal atmospheric
pressure in bar and also in torr?
ii) Open tube manometer: A manometer
consists of a U – shaped tube partly filled with
a low density liquid such as water or kerosene.
This helps in having a larger level difference
between the level of liquid in the two arms of
the manometer. Figure 2.14 shows an open
tube manometer. One arm of the manometer
is open to the atmosphere and the other is
connected to the container D of which the
pressure p is to be measured.

2.4 Surface Tension:
A liquid at rest shows a very interesting
property called surface tension. We have
seen that water spider walks on the surface
of steady water, greased needle floats on the
steady surface of water, rain drops and soap
bubbles always take spherical shape, etc.
All these phenomena arise due to surface
tension. Surface tension is one of the important
properties of liquids.

Fig. 2.14 Open tube
manometer.

Do you know?

The pressure at point A is atmospheric
pressure p0 because this arm is open to
atmosphere. To find the pressure at point C,
which is exposed to the pressure of the gas
in the container, we consider a point B in the
open arm of the manometer at the same level
as point C. The pressure at the points B and C
is the same, i.e.,
pC = pB				--- (2.12)
The pressure at point B is,
pB = po + hρg			--- (2.13)
where, ρ is the density of the liquid in the
manometer, h is the height of the liquid column
above point B, and g is the acceleration due
to gravity. According to Pascal’s principle,

to the paper.
2. When teacher writes on a board, chalk
particles stick to the board.
3. Mercury in a glass container does not
wet its surface, while water in a glass
container wets it.
2.4.1 Molecular Theory of Surface Tension:
All the above observations can be
explained on the basis of different types of
forces coming into play in all these situations.
We will try to understand the effect of these
forces and their relation to the surface tension
in liquids.
33

To understand surface tension, we need
to know some terms in molecular theory
that explain the behaviour of liquids at their
surface.
a) Intermolecular force: Matter is made up
of molecules. Any two molecules attract each
other. This force between molecules is called
intermolecular force. There are two types of
intermolecular forces - i) Cohesive force and
ii) Adhesive force.
i) Cohesive force: The force of attraction
between the molecules of the same
substance is called cohesive force or
force of cohesion. The force of attraction
between two air molecules or that between
two water molecules is a cohesive force.
Cohesive force is strongest in solids and
weakest in gases. This is the reason why
solids have a definite shape and gases do
not. Small droplets of liquid coalesce into
one and form a drop due to this force.
ii) Adhesive force: The force of attraction
between the molecules of different
substances is called adhesive force or
force of adhesion. The force of attraction
between glass and water molecule is a
force of adhesion.
b) Range of molecular force: The maximum
distance from a molecule up to which the
molecular force is effective is called the range
of molecular force. Intermolecular forces
are effective up to a distance of the order of
few nanometer (10-9 m) in solids and liquids.
Therefore, they are short range forces.
c) Sphere of influence: An imaginary sphere
with a molecule at its center and radius equal
to the molecular range is called the sphere of
influence of the molecule. The spheres around
molecules A, B or C are shown in Fig. 2.15 (a)
and (b). The intermolecular force is effective
only within the sphere of influence.
d) Surface film: The surface layer of a
liquid with thickness equal to the range of
intermolecular force is called the surface film.
This is the layer shown between XY and X′Y′
in Fig. 2.15 (b).

(a)

(b)
Fig. 2.15: (a) sphere of influence and
(b) surface film.

(e) Free surface of a liquid: It is the surface
of a fluid which does not experience any shear
stress. For example, the interface between
liquid water and the air above. In Fig. 2.15 (b),
XY is the free surface of the liquid.
Remember this
While studying pressure, we considered both
liquids and gases. But as gases do not have
a free surface, they do not exhibit surface
tension.
(f) Surface tension on the basis of molecular
theory: As shown in Fig. 2.15 (b), XY is the
free surface of liquid and X′Y′ is the inner
layer parallel to XY at distance equal to the
range of molecular force. Hence, the section
XX′-Y′Y near the surface of the liquid acts as
the surface film. Consider three molecules A,
B, and C such that molecule A is deep inside
the liquid, molecule B within surface film and
molecule C on the surface of the liquid.
As molecule A is deep inside the liquid, its
sphere of influence is also completely inside
the liquid. As a result, molecule A is acted
upon by equal cohesive forces in all directions.
Thus, the net cohesive force acting on molecule
A is zero.
Molecule B lies within the surface layer
and below the free surface of the liquid. A
larger part of its sphere of influence is inside
the liquid and a smaller part is in air. Due to
this, a strong downward cohesive force acts on
the liquid molecule. The adhesive force acting
on molecule B due to air molecules above it
and within its sphere of influence is weak. It
points upwards. As a result, the molecule B
gets attracted inside the liquid.
34

The same holds for molecule C which lies
exactly on the free surface of the liquid. Half
of the sphere of influence is in air and half in
the liquid. The number of air molecules within
the sphere of influence of the molecule C,
above the free surface of the liquid is much less
than the number of liquid molecules within the
sphere of influence that lies within the liquid.
This is because, the density of air is less than
that of a liquid. The adhesive force trying to
pull the molecule above the liquid surface is
much weaker than the cohesive force that tries
to pull the molecule inside the liquid surface.
As a result, the molecule C also gets attracted
inside the liquid.
Thus, all molecules in the surface film
are acted upon by an unbalanced net cohesive
force directed into the liquid. Therefore, the
molecules in the surface film are pulled inside
the liquid. This minimizes the total number of
molecules in the surface film. As a result, the
surface film remains under tension. The surface
film of a liquid behaves like a stretched elastic
membrane. This tension is known as surface
tension. The force due to surface tension acts
tangential to the free surface of a liquid.
2.4.2 Surface Tension and Surface Energy:
a) Surface Tension: As seen previously, the
free surface of a liquid in a container acts as
a stretched membrane and all molecules on
the surface film experience a stretching force.
Imagine a line PQ of length L drawn tangential
to the free surface of the liquid, as shown in
Fig. 2.16.

This force per unit length is the surface
tension. Surface tension T is defined as, the
tangential force acting per unit length on both
sides of an imaginary line drawn on the free
surface of liquid.
F
T = 			--- (2.15)
L
SI unit of surface tension is N/m. Its Dimension
are, [L0M1T-2].
Use your brain power
Prove that, equivalent S.I. unit of surface
tension is J/m2.
Example 2.4: A beaker of radius 10 cm
is filled with water. Calculate the force
of surface tension on any diametrical line
on its surface. Surface tension of water is
0.075 N/m.
Solution: Given,
L = 2 × 10 = 20 cm = 0.2 m
T = 0.075 N/m
We have,

b) Surface Energy: We have seen that a
molecule inside the volume of a liquid (like
molecule A in Fig 2.15) experiences more
cohesive force than a molecule like molecules
B and C in the surface film of the liquid in
that figure. Thus, work has to be done to bring
any molecule from inside the liquid into the
surface film. Clearly, the surface molecules
possess extra potential energy as compared
to the molecules inside the liquid. The extra

All the molecules on this line experience
equal and opposite forces tangential to surface
as if they are tearing the surface apart due
to the cohesive forces of molecules lying on
either side.
35

energy of the molecules in the surface layer
is called the surface energy of the liquid. As
any system always tries to attain a state of
minimum potential energy, the liquid tries to
reduce the area of its surface film. Energy has
to be spent in order to increase the surface area
of a liquid.

opposite to F) applied isothermally (gradually
and at constant temperature), to the arm
QR, so that it pulls the arm away and tries
to increase the surface area of the film. The
arm QR moves to Q′R′ through a distance dx.
Therefore, the work done against F, the force
due to surface tension, is given by
		
dw = F ′dx
Using Eq. (2.16),
		dw = T (2Ldx)
But, 2Ldx = dA, increase in area of the two
surfaces of the film. Therefore, dw = T(dA).
This work done in stretching the film is
stored in the area dA of the film as its potential
energy. This energy is called surface energy.
∴ Surface energy = T (dA)
--- (2.17)
Thus, surface tension is also equal to the
surface energy per unit area.

Remember this
1) Molecules on the liquid surface
experience net inward pull. In spite of
this if they remain at the surface, they
possess higher potential energy. As a
universal property, any system tries to
minimize its potential energy. Hence
liquid surface tries to minimize its
surface area.
2) When a number of droplets coalesce
and form a drop, there is reduction
in the total surface area. In this case,
energy is released to the surrounding.

Example 2.5: Calculate the work done
in blowing a soap bubble to a radius of
1 cm. The surface tension of soap solution is
2.5 × 10-2 N/m.
Solution: Given
T = 2.5 × 10-2 N/m
Initial radius of bubble = 0 cm
Final radius of bubble, r = 1 cm = 0.01 m
Initial surface area of soap bubble = 0
(A soap bubble has two surfaces, outer
surface and inner surface).
Final surface area of soap bubble is,
A = 2 × (4πr 2) = 8πr 2
∴change in area = dA = A – 0 = 8πr2
		
= 0.00251 m2
∴ work done = T × dA
= 2.5 × 10-2 × 0.251 × 10-2
= 6.275 × 10-5 J

c) Relation between the surface energy and
surface tension: Consider a rectangular frame
of wire P′PSS′. It is fitted with a movable arm
QR as shown in Fig. 2.17. This frame is dipped
in a soap solution and then taken out. A film
of soap solution will be formed within the
boundaries PQRS of the frame.

Fig. 2.17: Surface energy of a liquid

Each arm of the frame experiences an
inward force due to the film. Under the action
of this force, the movable arm QR moves
towards side PS so as to decrease the area
of the film. If the length of QR is L, then this
inward force F acting on it is given by
F = (T) × (2L) 			--- (2.16)
Since the film has two surfaces, the upper
surface and the lower surface, the total length
over which surface tension acts on QR is
2L. Imagine an external force F′ (equal and

film is formed on either side of thread.
Break the film on any one side of the thread.
Discuss the result.

Do you know?

Remember this
The work done, under isothermal condition,
against the force of surface tension to
change the surface area of a liquid is stored
as surface energy of liquid.

• when we observe the level of water in a
capillary, we note down the level of the
tangent to the meniscus inside the water.
• When we observe the level of mercury
in a capillary we note down the level of
the tangent to the meniscus above the
mercury column.

2.4.3 Angle of Contact:
When a liquid surface comes in contact
with a solid surface, it forms a meniscus,
which can be either convex (mercury-glass) or
concave (water glass), as shown in Fig. 2.18.
The angle of contact, θ , between a liquid and
a solid surface is defined as the angle between
the tangents drawn to the free surface of the
liquid and surface of the solid at the point of
contact, measured within the liquid.

a) Shape of meniscus:
i) Concave meniscus - acute angle of contact:

Fig. 2.19 (a): Acute angle of contact.

Figure 2.19 (a) shows the acute angle of
contact between a liquid surface (e.g., kerosene
in a glass bottle). Consider a molecule such as
A on the surface of the liquid near the wall of
the container. The molecule experiences both
cohesive as well as adhesive forces. In this case,
since
 the wall is vertical, the net adhesive force
A is horizontal,
( AP ) acting on the molecule

Net cohesive force ( AC ) acting on molecule is
directed at nearly 45o to either of the surfaces.
Magnitude of adhesive
force is so large that

the net force ( AR ) is directed inside the solid.
For equilibrium or stability
of a liquid

surface, the net force ( AR ) acting on the
molecule A must be normal to the liquid surface

at all points. For the resultant force AR to
be normal to the tangent, the liquid near the
wall should pile up against the solid boundary
so that the tangent AT to the liquid surface
is perpendicular to AR. Thus, this makes the
meniscus concave. Obviously, such liquid
wets that solid surface.
ii) Convex meniscus - obtuse angle of
contact:
Figure 2.19 (b) shows the obtuse angle
of contact between a liquid and a solid
(e.g., mercury in a glass bottle). Consider a
molecule such as A on the surface of the liquid

Fig. 2.18 (a): Concave meniscus due to liquids
which partially wet a solid surface.

When the angle of contact is acute, the
liquid forms a concave meniscus Fig. 2.18 (a)
at the point of contact. When the angle of
contact is obtuse, it forms a convex meniscus
Fig. 2.18 (b). For example, water-glass interface
forms a concave meniscus and mercury-glass
interface forms a convex meniscus.

Fig. 2.18 (b): Convex meniscus due to liquids
which do not wet a solid surface.

This difference between the shapes of
menisci is due to the net effect of the cohesive
forces between liquid molecules and adhesive
forces between liquid and solid molecules as
discussed below.
37

iv) Angle of contact 900 and conditions for
convexity and concavity:

near the wall of the container. The molecule
experiences both cohesive as well as adhesive
forces.
 In this case also, the net adhesive force
( AP ) acting on the molecule A is horizontal
since the wall is vertical. Magnitude of
cohesive
force is so large that the net force

( AR ) is directed inside the liquid.

Fig. 2.19 (d): Acute angle equal to 900.

Consider a hypothetical liquid having
angle of contact 900 with a given solid
container, as shown in the Fig.
2.19
 (d). In this
case, the net cohesive force AC is exactly at
450 with
either of the surfaces and the resultant
force AR is exactly vertical (along the solid
surface).

Fig. 2.19 (b): Obtuse angle of contact.

For equilibrium or stability
of a liquid

surface, the net force ( AR ) acting on all
molecules similar to molecule A must be
normal to the liquid surface at all points. The
liquid near the wall should, therefore, creep
inside against the solid boundary. This makes
the meniscus convex so that its tangent AT is
normal to AR. Obviously, such liquid does not
wet that solid surface.

How does a water proofing agent work?
b) Shape of liquid drops on a solid surface:
When a small amount of a liquid is
dropped on a plane solid surface, the liquid
will either spread on the surface or will form
droplets on the surface. Which phenomenon
will occur depends on the surface tension of
the liquid and the angle of contact between
the liquid and the solid surface. The surface
tension between the liquid and air as well as
that between solid and air will also have to be
taken in to account.
Let θ be the angle of contact for the given
solid-liquid pair.
T1 = Force due to surface tension at the liquidsolid interface,
T2 = Force due to surface tension at the airsolid interface,

Fig. 2.19 (c): Angle of contact equal to zero.

Figure 2.19 (c) shows the angle of
contact between a liquid (e.g. highly pure
water) which completely wets a solid
(e.g. clean glass) surface. The angle
of contact in this case is almost zero (i.e.,
θ → 00). In this case, the liquid molecules near
the contact region, are so less in number that

the cohesive force is negligible, i.e., AC =0
and the net adhesive
 force itself is the resultant
force, i.e., AP = AR . Therefore, the tangent
AT is along the wall within the liquid and the
angle of contact is zero.
38

T3 = Force due to surface tension at the airliquid interface.
As the force due to surface tension is
tangential to the surfaces in contact, directions
of T1, T2 and T3 are as shown in the Fig. 2.20.

and the angle of contact θ is acute as
shown in Fig. 2.20 (a).

2.4.4 Effect of impurity and temperature on
surface tension:
a) Effect of impurities:
i) When soluble substance such as common
salt (i.e., sodium chloride) is dissolved
in water, the surface tension of water
increases.
ii) When a sparingly soluble substance such
as phenol or a detergent is mixed with
water, surface tension of water decreases.
For example, a detergent powder is mixed
with water to wash clothes. Due to this,
the surface tension of water decreases and
water makes good contact with the fabric
and is able to remove tough stains.
iii) When insoluble impurity is added
into water, surface tension of water
decreases. When impurity gets added
to any liquid, the cohesive force of that
liquid decreases which affects the angle
of contact and hence the shape of the
meniscus. If mercury gathers dust then
its surface tension is reduced. It does not
form spherical droplets unless the dust is
completely removed.
b) Effect of temperature: In most liquids,
as temperature increases surface tension
decreases. For example, it is suggested that
new cotton fabric should be washed in cold
water. In this case, water does not make good
contact with the fabric due to its higher surface
tension. The fabric does not lose its colour
because of this.

obtuse as shown in Fig. 2.20(b).

equal to zero.

which is impossible. The liquid spreads
over the solid surface and drop will not be
formed.
c) Factors affecting the angle of contact:
The value of the angle of contact depends on
the following factors,
i) The nature of the liquid and the solid in
contact.
ii) Impurity : Impurities present in the liquid
change the angle of contact.
iii) Temperature of the liquid : Any increase
in the temperature of a liquid decreases its
angle of contact. For a given solid-liquid
surface, the angle of contact is constant at
a given temperature.

Hot water is used to remove tough stains
on fabric because of its lower surface tension.
In the case of molten copper or molten
cadmium, the surface tension increases with
increase in its temperature.
The surface tension of a liquid becomes
zero at critical temperature.
2.4.5 Excess pressure across the free surface
of a liquid:
Every molecule on a liquid surface
experiences forces due to surface tension
which are tangential to the liquid surface at
rest. The direction of the resultant force of
surface tension acting on a molecule on the
liquid surface depends upon the shape of that
liquid surface. This force also contributes in
deciding the pressure at a point just below the
surface of a liquid.
Figures 2.21 (a), (b) and (c) show surfaces
of three liquids with different shapes and their
menisci. Let f A be the downward force due to
the atmospheric pressure. All the three figures
show two molecules A and B. The molecule A
is just above, and the molecule B is just below
it (inside the liquid). Level difference between
A and B is almost zero, so that it does not
contribute anything to the pressure difference.
In all the three figures, the pressure at the point
A is the atmospheric pressure p.
a) Plane liquid surface:
Figure 2.21 (a) shows planar free surface
of the liquid. In this case,
 the resultant force

downward force f A . This develops greater
pressure at point B, which is inside the liquid
and on the concave side of the meniscus. Thus,
the pressure on the concave side i.e., inside the
liquid is greater than that on the convex side
i.e., outside the liquid.
c) Concave liquid surface:

Fig. 2.21 (c): Concave Surface.

Surface of the liquid in the Fig. 2.21 (c)
is upper concave (concave, when seen from
above). In

the net downward force responsible
for the

pressure at B is less than A . This develops a
lesser pressure at point B, which is inside the
liquid and on the convex side of the meniscus.
Thus, the pressure on the concave side i.e.,
outside the liquid, is greater than that on the
convex side, i.e., inside the liquid.
2.4.6 Explanation of formation of drops and
bubbles:
Liquid drops and small bubbles are
spherical in shape because the forces of surface
tension dominate the gravitational force.
These force always try to minimize the surface
area of the liquid. A bubble or drop does not
collapse because the resultant of the external
pressure and the force of surface tension is
smaller than the pressure inside a bubble or
inside a liquid drop.

b) Convex liquid surface:
Surface of the liquid in the Fig.2.21 (b)
is upper convex. (Convex, when seen from
above). In this case, the resultant force due
to surface tension, f T on the molecule at B
is vertically downwards and adds up to the

Consider a spherical drop as shown in
Fig. 2.22. Let pi be the pressure inside the drop
and p0 be the pressure out side it. As the drop is
spherical in shape, the pressure, pi, inside the
drop is greater than p0, the pressure outside.
Therefore, the excess pressure inside the drop
is pi- p0.

surface and the outer surface. For a bubble,
Eq. (2.19) charges to dA = 2(8πr∆r). Hence, total
increase in the surface area of a soap bubble,
while increasing its radius by ∆r, is 2(8πr∆r)
The work done by this excess pressure is
dW = (pi – p0) 4πr 2∆r = T(16πr∆r)
4T
		
--- (2.24)
∴ (pi – p0) =
r
Remember this
The gravitational force acting on a
molecule, which is its weight, is also one
of the forces acting within the sphere of
influence near the contact region. However,
within the sphere of influence, the cohesive
and adhesive forces are so strong that the
gravitational force can be neglected in the
above explanation.

Fig. 2.22. Excess pressure inside a liquid drop.

Let the radius of the drop increase from
r to r + ∆r, where ∆r is very small, so that
the pressure inside the drop remains almost
constant.
Let the initial surface area of the drop be
A1 = 4πr 2, and the final surface area of the
drop be A2 = 4π (r+∆r)2.
∴ A2 = 4π(r2 + 2r∆r + ∆r 2)
∴ A2 = 4πr2 + 8πr∆r + 4π∆r 2
As ∆r is very small, ∆r 2 can be neglected,
∴ A = 4πr 2 + 8πr∆r
2
Thus, increase in the surface area of the drop is
dA = A2 – A1 = 8πr∆r 		
--- (2.19)
Work done in increasing the surface area
by dA is stored as excess surface energy.
∴ dW = TdA= T (8πr∆r)
--- (2.20)
This work done is also equal to the product
of the force F which causes increase in the area
of the bubble and the displacement ∆r which is
the increase in the radius of the bubble.
∴ dW = F∆r 			--- (2.21)
The excess force is given by,
(Excess pressure) × (Surface area)
∴ F = (pi – p0) 4πr 2		
--- (2.22)
Equating Eq. (2.20) and Eq. (2.21), we get,
T(8πr∆r) = (pi – p0) 4πr 2∆r

∴ (pi – p0) =

spherical membrane.

Brain teaser:
1. Can you suggest any method to measure
the surface tension of a soap solution?
Will this method have any commercial
application?
2. What happens to surface tension under
different gravity (e.g. Space station or
lunar surface)?

of a water drop so that the excess pressure
inside it is 80 N/m2? (Surface tension of
water = 7.27 × 10-2 N/m)
Solution: Given
pi – po = 80 N/m2

2.4.7 Capillary Action:
A tube having a very fine bore ( ~ 1 mm)
and open at both ends is called a capillary
tube. If one end of a capillary tube is dipped in
a liquid which partially or completely wets the
surface of the capillary (like water in glass)
the level of liquid in the capillary rises. On the

than that on the convex side.
∴ pB > pA
As the points A and C are at the same level, the
pressure at both these points is the same, and it
is the atmospheric pressure.
--- (2.25)
∴pA = pC 			
Between the points C and D, the surface is
plane.
∴ pC = pD= pA			
--- (2.26)
∴ pB > pD. But the points B and D are at the
same horizontal level. Thus, in order to
maintain the same pressure, the mercury in the
capillary rushes out of the capillary. Because
of this, there is a drop in the level of mercury
inside the capillary as shown in Fig. 2.23 (b).

other hand, if the capillary tube is dipped in
a liquid which does not wet its surface (like
mercury in glass) the level of liquid in the
capillary drops.
The phenomenon of rise or fall of a liquid
inside a capillary tube when it is dipped in the
liquid is called capillarity. Capillarity is in
action when,
• Oil rises up the wick of a lamp.
• Cloth rag sucks water.
• Water rises up the crevices in rocks.
• Sap and water rise up to the top most
leaves in a tree.
• Blotting paper absorbs ink.
When a capillary is dipped in a liquid,
two effects can be observed, a) The liquid
level can rise in the capillary (water in a glass
capillary), or b) The liquid level can fall in the
capillary (mercury in glass capillary). Here we
discuss a qualitative argument to explain the
capillary fall.
a) Capillary fall:
Consider a capillary tube dipped in a
liquid which does not wet the surface, for
example, in mercury. The shape of mercury
meniscus in the capillary is upper convex.
Consider the points A, B, C, and D such that,
(see Fig. 2.23 (a)).
i) Point A is just above the convex surface
and inside the capillary.
ii) Point B is just below the convex surface
inside the capillary.
iii) Point C is just above the plane surface
outside the capillary.
iv) Point D is just below the plane surface
and outside the capillary, and below the
point C.

Fig. 2.23 (b): Capillary in mercury, drop in level.

b) Capillary rise:
Refer to Fig. 2.24 (a) and Fig. 2.24 (b) and
explain the rise of a liquid inside a capillary.

Fig. 2.24 (a): Capillary just immersed in water.

Fig. 2.24 (b): Capillary in water after rise in level.

Expression for capillary rise or fall:
Method (I): Using pressure difference
The pressure due to the liquid (water)
column of height h must be equal to the
pressure difference 2T/R due to the concavity.

Fig. 2.23 (a) : Capillary in mercury before drop in level.

Let pA, pB, pC, and pD be the values of
the pressures at the points A, B, C, and D
respectively. As discussed previously, the
pressure on the concave side is always greater

acceleration due to gravity.
Let r be the radius of the capillary tube

The above equation gives the expression
for capillary rise (or fall) for a liquid. Narrower
the tube, the greater is the height to which the
liquid rises (or falls).
If the capillary tube is held vertical in
a liquid that has a convex meniscus, then
the angle of contact θ is obtuse. Therefore,
cos θ is negative and so is h. This means
that the liquid will suffer capillary fall or
depression.
b) (Method II): Using forces:
Rise of water inside a capilary is against
gravity. Hence, weight of the liquid column
must be equal and opposite to the proper
component of force due to surface tension at
the point of contact.

between mercury and glass. Surface tension
of mercury is 0.465 N/m and its density is
13.6 × 103 kg/m3. (g = 9.8 m/s2)
Solution: Given,
r = 5 × 10-4 m

2.5 Fluids in Motion:
We come across moving fluids in our day
to day life. The flow of water through our taps,
the flow of cooking gas through tubes, or the
flow of water through a river or a canal can
be understood using the concepts developed in
this section.
The branch of Physics which deals with
the study of properties of fluids in motion is
called hydrodynamics. As the study of motion
of real fluid is very complicated, we shall limit
our study to the motion of an ideal fluid. We
have discussed an ideal fluid in the beginning
of this Chapter. Study of a fluid in motion is
very important.
Consider Fig. 2.26 which shows a pipe
whose direction and cross sectional area
change arbitrarily. The direction of flow of the
fluid in pipe is as shown. We assume an ideal
fluid to flow through the pipe. We define a few
terms used to describe flow of a fluid.

Flow line: It is the path of an individual particle
in a moving fluid as shown in Fig. 2.26.
Streamline: It is a curve whose tangent at
any point in the flow is in the direction of the
velocity of the flow at that point. Streamlines
and flow lines are identical for a steady flow.
Flow tube: It is an imaginary bundle of flow
lines bound by an imaginary wall. For a steady
flow, the fluid cannot cross the walls of a flow
tube. Fluids in adjacent flow tubes cannot mix.
Laminar flow/Streamline flow: It is a steady
flow in which adjacent layers of a fluid
move smoothly over each other as shown in
Fig. 2.27 (a). A steady flow of river can be
assumed to be a laminar flow.
Turbulent flow: It is a flow at a very high
flow rate so that there is no steady flow and the
flow pattern changes continuously as shown in
Fig. 2.27 (b). A flooded river flow or a tap
running very fast is a turbulent flow.

Table 2.3 Streamline Flow and Turbulent Flow

Streamline flow
1) The smooth flow of a fluid, with velocity
smaller than certain critical velocity (limiting
value of velocity) is called streamline flow or
laminar flow of a fluid.
2) In a streamline flow, velocity of a fluid at a
given point is always constant.
3) Two streamlines can never intersect, i.e., they
are always parallel.

Turbulent flow
1) The irregular and unsteady flow of a fluid
when its velocity increases beyond critical
velocity is called turbulent flow.

2) In a turbulent flow, the velocity of a fluid
at any point does not remain constant.
3) In a turbulent flow, at some points, the
fluid may have rotational motion which
gives rise to eddies.
4) Streamline flow over a plane surface can be 4) A flow tube loses its order and particles

layers. In a flow of liquid through a pipe of
uniform cross sectional area, all the streamlines
will be parallel to the axis of the tube.

less than 1000, the flow of a fluid is streamline
while for Rn greater than 2000, the flow of
fluid is turbulent. When Rn is between 1000
and 2000, the flow of fluid becomes unsteady,
i.e., it changes from a streamline flow to a
turbulent flow.
2.6.1 Viscosity:
When we pour water from a glass, it flows
freely and quickly. But when we pour syrup
or honey, it flows slowly and sticks to the
container. The difference is due to fluid friction.
This friction is both within the fluid itself and
between the fluid and its surroundings. This
property of fluids is called viscosity. Water
has low viscosity, whereas syrup or honey has
high viscosity. Figure 2.28 shows a schematic
section of viscous flow and Fig. 2.29 that of a
non viscous flow. Note that there is no dragging
force in the non-viscous flow, and all layers are
moving with the same velocity.

Fig. 2.27 (a): Streamline flow.

What would happen if two streamlines
intersect?
Activity

and turbulent flow in every day life. How
would you explain them? When would
your prefer a stream line flow?

Fig. 2.28: Viscous flow. Different layers flow with
different velocities. The central layer flows the
fastest and the outermost layers flow the slowest.

2.6 Critical Velocity and Reynolds number:
The flow of a fluid, whether streamline
or turbulent, is differentiated on the basis
of velocity of the flow. The velocity beyond
which a streamline flow becomes turbulent is
called critical velocity.
According to Osborne Reynolds (1842 1912), critical velocity is given by

fluid that is almost non-viscous is liquid

study viscosity of a fluid and how it affects the
flow of a fluid.

Reynolds number is a pure number. It has
no unit and dimensions. It is found that for Rn

Fig. 2.29: Non-viscous flow. Different layers
flow with the same velocity.

If we observe the flow of river water, it
is found that the water near both sides of the
river bank flows slow and as we move towards
the center of the river, the water flows faster
gradually. At the centre, the flow is the fastest.
From this observation it is clear that there is
some opposing force between two adjacent
layers of fluids which affects their relative
motion.
45

The coefficient of viscosity can be
defined as the viscous force per unit area per
unit velocity gradient. S.I. unit of viscosity is
Ns/m2.

Viscosity is that property of fluid, by virtue
of which, the relative motion between different
layers of a fluid experience a dragging force.
This force is called the viscous drag. This is
shown schematically in Fig. 2.30.

Use your brain power
CGS unit of viscosity is Poise. Find the
relation between Poise and the SI unit of
viscosity.
A Microsopic View of Viscosity:
Viscosity of a fluid can be explained
on the basic of molecular motion as follow.
Consider the laminar flow between plats
X and Y as shown in the figure. Plate X is
stationary and plate Y moves with a velocity
v0. Layers a, b, and c move with velocity,
v-dv, v, and v + dv respectively. Consider
two adjacent layers, b and c. The velocity
of the fluid is equal to mean velocity of the
molecules contained in that layer. Thus,
the mean velocity of the molecules in
layer b is v, while the molecules in layers
c have a slightly greater mean velocity
v + dv. As you will learn in the next
chapter, each molecule possesses a random
velocity whose magnitude is usually larger
than that of the mean velocity. As a result,
molecules are continually transferred in
large numbers between the two layers. On
the average, molecules passing from layer

Fig. 2.30: Change in velocity of layer as its
distance from a referee layer changes.

In liquids, the viscous drag is due to short
range molecular cohesive forces, and in gases
it is due to collisions between fast moving
molecules. In both liquids and gases, as long
as the relative velocity between the layers is
small, the viscous drag is proportional to the
relative velocity. However, in a turbulent flow,
the viscous drag increases rapidly and is not
proportional to relative velocity but proportional
to higher powers of relative velocity.
Velocity gradient: The rate of change of
velocity (dv) with distance (dx) measured
from a stationary layer is called velocity
gradient (dv/dx).
2.6.2 Coefficient of viscosity:
According to Newton’s law of viscosity,
for a streamline flow, viscous force (f) acting
on any layer is directly proportional to the
area (A) of the layer and the velocity gradient
(dv/dx) i.e.,

c to layer b will be moving too fast for
their 'new' layer by an amount dv and will
slow down as a result of collisions with the
molecules in layer b. The result is a transfer
of momentum from faster-moving layers c
to their neighboring slower-moving layers
such as b and thus eventually to plate X.
Because the original source of this transfer
of momentum is plate Y, the overall result
is a transfer of momentum from plate Y

where η is a constant, called coefficient of
viscosity of the liquid. From Eq. (2.34) we can
write,

2.7 Stokes’ Law:
In 1845, Sir George Gabriel Stokes (18191903) stated the law which gives the viscous
force acting on a spherical object falling
through a viscous medium (see Fig. 2.31).

to plate X. If there are no external forces
applied, this momentum transfer would
reduce speed of the plate Y to zero with
respect to the plate X.
Reduction in the velocity of the
molecules in the direction of laminar flow
is due to the fact that their directions after
collision are random. This randomness, to be
discussed in Chapter 3, results in an increase
in the thermal energy of the fluid at the cost
of its macrosopic kinetic energy. That is, the
process is dissipative, or frictional.
In liquids there is an additional,
stronger interaction between molecules in
adjacent layers, due to the intermolecular
forces that distinguish liquid from gases.
As a result, there is a transfer of momentum
from faster-moving layers to slower-moving
layers, which results in a viscous drag.

Fig 2.31: Spherical object moving through a
viscous medium.

The law states that, “The viscous force
(Fv) acting on a small sphere falling through
a viscous medium is directly proportional
to the radius of the sphere (r), its velocity
(v) through the fluid, and the coefficient of
viscosity (η) of the fluid”.

This is the expression for viscous force
acting on a spherical object moving through
a viscous medium. The above formula can be
derived using dimensional analysis.

Remember this
Coefficient of viscosity of a fluid changes
with change in its temperature. For
most liquids, the coefficient of viscosity
decreases with increase in their temperature.
It probably depends on the fact that at
higher temperatures, the molecules are
farther apart and the cohesive forces or
inter-molecular forces are, therefore, less
effective. Whereas, in gases, the coefficient
of viscosity increases with the increase
in temperature. This is because, at high
temperatures, the molecules move faster
and collide more often with each other,
giving rise to increased internal friction.

Example 2.8: A steel ball with radius
0.3 mm is falling with velocity of 2 m/s at
a time t, through a tube filled with glycerin,
having coefficient of viscosity 0.833 Ns/m2.
Determine viscous force acting on the steel
ball at that time.
Solution: Given
r = 0.3 mm = 0.3 × 10-3 m, v = 2 m/s,
η = 0.833 Ns/m2.
We have, F  6 rv

2.7.1 Terminal Velocity:
Consider a spherical object falling

it during its downward motion are,

Its magnitude goes on increasing with
increase in its velocity.

The above equation gives coefficient of
viscosity of a fluid.

2. Gravitational force, or its weight (Fg),
directed downwards, and
3. Buoyant force or upthrust (Fu), directed
upwards.
Net downward force given by
f = Fg - (Fv+ Fu), is responsible for initial increase
in the velocity. Among the given forces, Fg and
Fu are constant while Fv increases with increase
in velocity. Thus, a stage is reached when
the net force f becomes zero. At this stage,
Fg = Fv + Fu. After that, the downward velocity
remains constant. This constant downward
velocity is called terminal velocity. Obviously,
now onwards, the viscous force Fv is also
constant. The entire discussion necessarily
applies to streamline flow only.

Example 2.9: A spherical drop of oil falls
at a constant speed of 4 cm/s in steady air.
Calculate the radius of the drop. The density
of the oil is 0.9 g/cm3, density of air is
1.0 g/cm3 aud the coefficient of viscosity of
air is 1.8 × 10-4 poise, (g = 980 cm/s2)
Solution: Given,
v = 4 cm/s
η = 1.8 × 10-4 Poise
σ = 0. 9 g/cm3
ρ = 1 g/cm3

The velocity with which an object can

2.8 Equation of Continuity:
Consider a steady flow of an
incompressible fluid as shown in Fig. 2.33. For
a steady flow, the velocity of a particle remains
constant at a given point but it can vary from
point to point. For example, consider section
A1 and A2 in Fig. 2.33. Section A1 has larger
cross sectional area than the section A2. Let v1
and v2 be the velocities of the fluid at sections
A1 and A2 respectively.
This is because, a particle has to move
faster in the narrower section (where there is

i.e.,

. The quantity
is the volume

of a fluid per unit time passing through any
cross section of the tube of flow. It is called
the volume flux. Similarly, ρdV/dt =dm/dt is
called mass flux.
Equation (2.40) is called the equation of
continuity in fluid dynamics. The continuity
equation says that the volume rate of flow of
an incompressible fluid for a steady flow is
the same throughout the flow.

less space) to accommodate particles behind
it hence its velocity increases. When a particle
enters a wider section, it slows down because
there is more space. Because the fluid is
incompressible, the particles moves faster
through a narrow section and slow down while
moving through wider section. If the fluid does
not move faster in a narrow regain, it will be
compressed to fit into the narrow space.
Consider a tube of flow as shown in
Fig. 2.33. All the fluid that passes through
a tube of flow must pass through any cross
section that cuts the tube of flow. We know
that all the fluid is confined to the tube of flow.
Fluid can not leave the tube or enter the tube.
Consider section A1 and A2 located at
points A and B respectively as shown in
Fig. 2.33. Matter is neither created nor
destroyed within the tube enclosed between
section A1 and A2. Therefore, the mass of the
fluid within this region is constant over time.
That means, if mass m of the fluid enters the
section A1 then equal mas of fluid should leave
the section A2.
Let the speed of the fluid which crosses
the section EFGH at point A in time interval
∆t be v1. Thus, the volume of the fluid entering
the tube through the cross section at point A
is ρA1v1∆t. Similarly, let the speed of the fluid
be v2 at point B. The fluid crosses the section
PQRS of area A2 in time interval ∆t. Thus, the
mass of the fluid leaving the tube through the
cross section at B is ρA2v2∆t.
As fluid is incompressible, the mass of the
fluid entering the tube at point A is the same as
the mass leaving the tube at B.
Mass of the fluid in section EFGH = mass
of fluid in section PQRS

v1 = 2 cm/s = 2 × 10-2 m/s

surrounding fluid is equal to the sum of the
change in the kinetic energy and the change in
the gravitational potential energy.
Figure 2.34 shows flow of an ideal fluid
through a tube of varying cross section and
height. Consider an element of fluid that lies
between cross sections P and R.
Let,
• v1 and v2 be the speed the fluid at the lower
end P and the upper end R respectively.
• A1 and A2 be the cross section area of the
fluid at the lower end P and the upper end
R respectively.
• p1 and p2 be the pressures of the fluid at the
lower end P and the upper R respectively.
• d1 and d2 be the distances travelled by the
fluid at the lower and P and the upper and
R during the time interval dt with velocities
v1 and v2 respectively.
• p1 A1 and p2 A2 be the forces acting on the
equation of continuity, (Eq.  
2.40), the
volume dV of the fluid passing through any
cross section during time interval dt is the
same; i.e.,
dV = A1d1 = A2d2
--- (2.41)
There is no internal friction in the fluid as
the fluid is ideal. In practice also, for a fluid like
water, the loss in energy due to viscous force is
negligible. So the only non-gravitational force
that does work on the fluid element is due to the
pressure of the surrounding fluid. Therefore,
the net work, W, done on the element by the
surrounding fluid during the flow from P to R
is,
W = p1A1d1 – p2A2d2
The second term in the above equation has
a negative sign because the force at R opposes
the displacement of the fluid. From Eq. (2.41)
the above equation can be written as,
W = p1dV – p2dV
∴ W = (p1-p2) dV 		
--- (2.42)
As the work W is due to forces other than
the conservative force of gravity, it equals the
change in the total mechanical energy i.e.,
kinetic energy plus gravitational potential
energy associated with the fluid element.
i.e., W = ∆K.E. + ∆P.E. 		 --- (2.43)
The mechanical energy for the fluid
between sections Q and R does not change.

2.9 Bernoulli Equation:
On observing a river, we notice that the
speed of the water decreases in wider region
whereas the speed of water increases in the
regions where the river is narrow. From this
we might think that the pressure in narrower
regions is more than that in the wider region.
However, the pressure within the fluid in the
narrower parts is less while that in wider parts
is more.
Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli (17001782), while experimenting with fluid inside
pipes led to the discovery of the concept
mentioned above. He observed, in his
experiment, that the speed of a fluid in a narrow
region increases but the internal pressure of a
fluid in the same narrow region decreases. This
phenomenon is called Bernoulli’s principle.

Fig. 2.34: Flow of fluid through a tube of
varying cross section and height.

Bernoulli’s equation relates the speed of a
fluid at a point, the pressure at that point and
the height of that point above a reference level.
It is an application of work – energy theorem
for a fluid in flow. While deriving Bernoulli’s
equation, we will prove that the net work
done on a fluid element by the pressure of the

Dimensionally, pressure is energy per unit

above equation have dimensions of energy
per unit volume. Hence, quite often, the
left side is referred to as pressure energy
per unit volume. The left side of equation
is called pressure head. The first term on
the right side is called the velocity head
and the second term is called the potential
head.
In other words, the Bernoulli’s principle
is thus consistent with the principle of
conservation of energy.

Also, at the beginning of the time interval

mass m between P and Q is mgh1 = ρdVgh1.
At the end of the interval dt, the gravitational
potential energy of the mass m between R and
S is mgh2 = ρdVgh2. Therefore, the net change
in the gravitational potential energy, ∆P.E.,

the fluid is at rest? How?

If A2<<A1, the above equation reduces to,

Applications of Bernoulli’s equation:
a) Speed of efflux:
The word efflux means fluid out flow.
Torricelli discovered that the speed of efflux
from an open tank is given by a formula
identical to that of a freely falling body.

This is the equation of the speed of a
liquid flowing out through an orifice at a depth
‘h’ below the free surface. It is the same as that
of a particle falling freely through the height
‘h’ under gravity.
Example 2.13: Doors of a dam are 20 m
below the surface of water in the dam. If
one door is opened, what will be the speed
of the water that flows out of the door?
(g = 9.8 m/s2)
Solution: Given, h = 20 m
From Toricelli’s law,
v = 2gh = 2 ×9.8 ×20 = 392
= 19.79 m/s

Fig. 2.35: Efflux of fluid from an orifice.

b) Ventury tube:
A ventury tube is used to measure the
speed of flow of a fluid in a tube. It has a
constriction in the tube. As the fluid passes
through the constriction, its speed increases
in accordance with the equation of continuity.
The pressure thus decreases as required by the
Bernoulli equation.

Consider a liquid of density ‘ρ’ filled in a
tank of large cross-sectional area A1 having an
orifice of cross-sectional area A2 at the bottom
as shown in Fig. 2.35. Let A2<<A1. The liquid
flows out of the tank through the orifice. Let
v1 and v2 be the speeds of the liquid at A1 and
A2 respectively. As both, inlet and outlet, are
exposed to the atmosphere, the pressure at
these position equals the atmosphere pressure
p0. If the height of the free surface above the
orifice is h, Bernoulli’s equation gives us,

through a cross section can be calculated by
knowing the areas A1and A2.

Fig. 2.38: Atomizer.

The action of the carburetor of an
automobile engine, paint-gun, scent-spray
or insect-sprayer is based on the Bernoulli’s
principle. In all these, a tube T is dipped in a
liquid as shown in Fig. 2.38. Air is blown at
high speed over the tip of this tube with the help
of a piston P in the cylinder C. This high speed
air creates low pressure over the tube, due to
which the liquid rises in it and is then blown off
in very small droplets with expelled air.
e) Blowing off of roofs by stormy wind:

Example 2.13: Water flows through a
tube as shown in the given figure. Find the
difference in mercury level, if the speed of
flow of water at point A is 2 m/s and at point
B is 5 m/s. (g = 9.8 m/s)

c) Lifting up of an aeroplane:

Fig. 2.39: Airflow along a roof.

When high speed, stormy wind blows
over a roof top, it causes low pressure p above
the roof in accordance with the Bernoulli’s
principle. However, the air below the roof
(i.e. inside the room) is still at the atmospheric
pressure p0. So, due to this difference in
pressure, the roof is lifted up and is then blown
off by the wind as shown in Fig. 2.39.

Fig. 2.37: Airflow along an aerofoil.

The shape of cross section of wings
of an aeroplane is as shown in Fig. 2.37.
When an aeroplane runs on a runway, due to
aerodynamic shape of its wings, the streamlines
of air are crowded above the wings compared
to those below the wings. Thus, the air above
the wings moves faster than that below the
wings. According to the Bernoulli’s principle,
the pressure above the wings decreases and

The laws of Boyle, Charles, and GayLussac are strictly valid for real gases, only
if the pressure of the gas is not too high and
the temperature is not close to the liquefaction
temperature of the gas.

an ideal gas.

liquid and gaseous states?

the gas laws?

gases?
8. What is elastic collision of particles?
9. What is Dalton's law of partial pressures?
3.1. Introduction:
You have been introduced to the three
common states of matter viz. solid, liquid
and gas. You have also studied the gas laws:
Boyle's law, Charles' law, and Gay-Lussac's
law. The ideal gas equation can be obtained
from the three gas laws.
The volume V of a gas is inversely
proportional to the pressure P, temperature
being held constant. Separately, volume V
and pressure P are directly proportional to
temperature. In a nut shell,
Boyle's law: V ∝ 1/P at constant T --- (3.1)
Charles' law V ∝ T at constant P
--- (3.2)
Gay-Lussac's law: P ∝ T at constant V--- (3.3)
All the three laws apply to fixed mass m
of an enclosed gas.
Combining the three laws into a single
relation for a fixed mass of gas yields ideal
gas equation. Thus,
PV P V
PV ∝ T, or 1 1 = 2 2

Equation of State: For a gas, its state is
specified by a number of physical quantities
such as pressure P, temperature T, volume
V, internal energy E, etc. Hence, the
equation relating these quantities is known
as the equation of state.
3.2 Behaviour of a Gas:
A stone thrown upwards in air reaches
a certain height and falls back to the ground.
Its motion can be described well with the
help of Newton's laws of motion. A gas
enclosed in a container is characterized by its
pressure, volume and, temperature. This is the
macroscopic description of the gas. You know
that the particles of the gas (molecules) are in
constant motion. Unlike in the case of motion
of the stone, it is very difficult to understand
the behaviour of a gas in terms of motion of
a single particle (molecule). The number of
particles in the gas is itself so large (∼ 1023
particles per m3) that any attempt to relate the
macroscopic parameters P, V, T and E with the
motion of individual particles would be futile.
56

Hence, certain assumptions are made
regarding the particles (molecules) of a gas,
averages of physical quantities over the large
number of particles involved are obtained
and these averages are finally related to the
macroscopic parameters of the gas. This is the
approach of kinetic theory of gases.
3.3 Ideal Gas and Real Gas:
We know that a gas obeying ideal gas
equation at all pressures and temperatures is
an ideal gas. In an ideal gas intermolecular
interactions are absent. Real gases are
composed of atoms or molecules which do
interact with each other. Hence, no real gas
is truly ideal as defined here. If the atoms/
molecules of a real gas are so far apart that
there is practically no interatomic/
intermolecular interaction, the real gas is
said to be in the ideal state. This can happen
at sufficiently low density of the real gas.
At low pressures or high temperatures,
the molecules are far apart and therefore
molecular interactions are negligible. Under
these conditions, behaviour of real gases
is close to that of an ideal gas. Of course,
the temperature of the real gas must be well
above its liquefaction temperature. Ideal gas
serves as a model to deduce certain properties
of real gases at least when the real gas is in
the ideal state. You have studied deviation of
real gas from ideal gas behaviour in XIth Std.
Chemistry.

Fig. 3.1 (a): A gas with
molecules dispersed in
the container: A stop
action photograph.

Fig. 3.1 (b): A typical
molecule in a gas
executing random
motion.

The molecules of a gas are uniformly
dispersed throughout the volume of the gas
as shown in Fig 3.1(a). These molecules are
executing random motion. Typical path of
a molecule is shown in Fig. 3.1 (b). When
a molecule approaches another molecule,
there is a repulsive force between them, due
to which the molecules behave as small
hard spherical particles. This leads to elastic
collisions between the molecules. Therefore,
both the speed and the direction of motion of
the molecules change abruptly. The molecules
also collide with the walls of the container.
Molecules exert force on each other only
during collisions. Thus, in between two
successive collisions the molecules move
along straight paths with constant velocity. It
is convenient and useful to define mean free
path (λ), as the average distance traversed by
a molecule with constant velocity between
two successive collisions. The mean free path
is expected to vary inversely with the density
N
of the gas   , where N is the number of
V
molecules enclosed in a volume V. Higher the
density, more will be the collisions and smaller
will be the mean free path λ. It is also seen that
λ is inversely proportional to the size of the
molecule, say the diameter d. Smaller the size
of the molecule, less is the chance for collision
and larger is the mean free path. Further, λ is
inversely proportional to d2, not just d, because
it depends on the cross section of a molecule. It
can be shown that

1. Why is the deviation of real gas from
ideal gas behavior observed at high
pressure and low temperature?
2. What is the effect of size of the
molecules of a real gas, as against the
ideal gas comprising point particles, on
the properties of the gas ?
3. Does an ideal gas exist in reality?
3.4 Mean Free Path:
How do the molecules of an ideal gas
move? These molecules are in continuous
random motion such as Brownian motion you
have studied in XIth Std. Chemistry.

Fig. 3.2: A cubical box of side L. It contains
n moles of an ideal gas. The figure shows a
molecule of mass m moving towards the
 shaded
wall of the cube with velocity v .

The gas molecules are continuously
moving randomly in various directions,
colliding with each other and hitting the walls
of the box and bouncing back. As a first
approximation, we neglect intermolecular
collisions and consider only elastic collisions
with the walls. (It is not unphysical to assume
this, because, as explained earlier, the mean
free path increases as the pressure is reduced.
Thus, pressure is so adjusted that the molecules
do not collide with each other, but collide with
the walls). A typical molecule is shown
in the

Fig. 3.2 moving with the velocity v , about to
collide with the shaded wall of the cube. The
wall is parallel to yz-plane. As the collision
is assumed to be elastic, during collision, the
component vx of the velocity will get reversed,
keeping vy and vz components unaltered.

Note that this is about 247 times molecular

If the pressure of a gas in an enclosure is
reduced by evacuating it, the density of
the gas decreases and the mean free path
increases. You must have seen articles
coated with metal films. The metals are
heated and evaporated in an enclosure.
The pressure in the enclosure is reduced
so that the mean free path of air molecules
is larger than the dimensions of the
enclosure. The atoms in the metal vapour
then do not collide with the air molecules.
They reach the target and get deposited.

Consider two dimensional elastic collision
of a particle with a wall along the y-axis
as shown in the accompanying figure. It
can be easily seen that the vx component is
reversed, vy remaining unchanged.

3.5 Pressure of Ideal Gas:
We now express pressure of an ideal
gas as a kinetic theory problem. Let there be
n moles of an ideal gas enclosed in a cubical
box of volume V (= L3) with sides of the box
parallel to the coordinate axes, as shown in Fig.
3.2. The walls of the box are kept at a constant
temperature T. The question is: can we relate
the pressure P of the gas with the molecular
speeds? Here we will use the word molecular
speed rather than molecular velocity since the
kinetic energy of a molecule depends on the
velocity irrespective of its direction.
58

Considering all the molecules, their
average y and z components of the velocities
are not changed by collisions with the
shaded wall. This can be understood from
the fact that the gas molecules remain evenly
distributed throughout the volume and do not
get any additional motion in +y or -y and +z
or -z directions. Thus the y and z components
remain unchanged during collision with the
wall parallel to the yz-plane.
Hence the change in momentum of the
particle is only in the x component of the
momentum, ∆px is given by
∆px = final momentum - initial momentum
= (-mvx) - (mvx) = - 2 mvx
--- (3.7)
Thus, the momentum transferred to the
wall during collision is + 2mvx . The rebounced
molecule then goes to the opposite wall and
collides with it.
We now set the average force exerted by
one molecule on the wall equal to the average
rate of change of momentum during the time
for one collision. To find this average rate, we
have to divide the change in momentum by the
time taken for one collision.
After colliding with the shaded wall,
the molecule travels to the opposite wall and
is reflected back. It travels back towards the
shaded wall again to collide with the shaded
wall. This means that the molecule travels a
distance of 2L in between two collisions. Hence
to get the average force, we have to divide by
the time between two successive collisions.
As L is the length of the cubical box, the
time for the molecule to travel back and forth
to the shaded wall is t  2 L .

Equation (3.10) has been obtained for a
cubical shaped container. However, it can be
shown to be valid for containers of any shape.
Also, we have assumed that there are no intermolecular collisions. The number of molecules
in the container is so large (of the order of
1023) that even if molecular collisions are
taken into account, the above expression does
not change. If a molecule acquires a velocity
with components different than vx, vy, vz after
collision, there will invariably be some other
molecule having different initial velocity now
acquiring the velocity with the components vx,
vy, vz. As the gas is steady (in equilibrium), this
must be happening. Thus the collisions do not
affect Eq. (3.10).

Equation (3.12) allows us to estimate rms

gas, at 300 K, the rms speed in 517 m/s, while
for oxygen gas it is 483 m/s.

adiabatic ratio. Its maximum value is 5/3, for
monatomic gases. The sound wave cannot
move faster than the average speed of the
molecules (since γ < 3). However, the two
speeds are of the same order of magnitude.
The molecules serve as a medium to transport
sound energy. The speed of sound in H2 gas is
comparable to the rms speed of H2 molecules
and in N2 gas to the rms speed of N2 molecules.

many molecules will have speeds greater
or smaller than vrms? Molecules can have
varying speeds in the range zero to infinity.
What is the number of molecules having a
particular speed in this range? This function,
the number of molecules as a function of the
speed is known as the distribution of speeds.
Figure shows a typical distribution of speeds
for a gas at a temperature T. This is known
as Maxwell's distribution of molecular
speeds. Here, the shaded area nv dv is the
number of molecules having speed between

motion along a straight line.
We say that the molecule is free to
execute 3, 2, and 1 dimensional translational
motion in the above examples. In other words,
the molecule in these examples has 3, 2, and 1
degrees/degree of freedom.
Degrees of freedom of a system are
defined as the total number of coordinates or
independent quantities required to describe
the position and configuration of the system

contribution of the molecule is (3/2)kBT.
3.8.1 Degrees of Freedom:
In the above discussion, the molecule
as a whole is free to move from one point
to the other in the three dimensional space.
If it is restricted to move in a plane surface
which is two dimensional, then only two
coordinates say x and y will be sufficient to
describe its location and two components vx,
vy will describe its motion in the plane. If a

lying along the x-axis.

Monatomic gas like helium contains He
atoms. An He atom has 3 translational degrees
of freedom (dof). Consider for example, O2 or
N2 molecule with the two atoms lying along
the x-axis. The molecule has 3 translational
dof. In addition, it can rotate around z-axis and
y-axis. Figure 3.3 depicts rotation of molecule
about the z-axis. Like wise, rotation is possible
about the y-axis. (Note that rotation around
the x-axis is not a rotation in the sense that it
does not involve change of positions of the two
atoms of the molecule). In general, a diatomic
molecule can rotate about its centre of mass
in two directions that are perpendicular to
its molecular axis. The molecules like O2,
are therefore, said to possess 2 additional
dof namely 2 rotational dof. Each of these
2 dof contribute to rotational kinetic energy.

with each quadratic term is

2
law of equipartition of energy is valid for
high temperatures and not for extremely low
temperatures where quantum effects become
important.
3.9 Specific Heat Capacity:
You know that when the temperature of
a gas is increased, even a small rise causes
considerable change in volume and pressure.
Therefore two specific heats are defined for
gases, namely specific heat at constant volume
CV and specific heat at constant pressure CP.
Mayer’s relation gives an expression that
connects the two specific heats.
3.9.1 Mayer’s Relation:
Consider one mole of an ideal gas that
is enclosed in a cylinder by light, frictionless
airtight piston. Let P, V and T be the pressure,
volume and temperature respectively of the
gas. If the gas is heated so that its temperature
rises by dT, but the volume remains constant,
then the amount of heat supplied to the gas,
dQ1, is used to increase the internal energy
of the gas (dE). Since, volume of the gas is
constant, no work is done in moving the piston.

translational and rotational dof is

The above expression contains quadratic
terms that correspond to various dof of a
diatomic molecule. Each of them contributes
1
k BT to the total energy of the molecule. In
2
the above discussion, an implicit assumption
was made that the rotating molecule is
a rigid rotator. However, real molecules
contain covalent bonds between the atoms
and therefore can perform additional motion
namely vibrations of atoms about their mean
positions like a one-dimensional harmonic
oscillator. Such molecules therefore possess
additional dof corresponding to the different
modes of vibration. In diatomic molecules like
O2, N2 and CO, the atoms can oscillate along
the internuclear axis only. This motion adds
energy associated with the vibrations to the
total energy of the molecule.
E = E (translational) +E (rotational)+
E (vibrational) 			--- (3.21)

∴ dQ1 = dE = CV dT 		
--- (3.23)
where CV is the molar specific heat of the gas
at constant volume.
On the other hand, if the gas is heated to
the same temperature, at constant pressure,
volume of the gas increases by an amount say
dV. The amount of heat supplied to the gas
is used to increase the internal energy of the
gas as well as to move the piston backwards
to allow expansion of gas (the work done to
move the piston dW = PdV)
dQ2 = dE + dW = CP dT
--- (3.24)
where CP is the molar specific heat of the gas
at constant pressure.
But dE = CV dT from Eq. (3.23) as the internal
energy of an ideal gas depends only on its
temperature.
∴ CP dT = CV dT + dW
or,
(CP – CV) dT = P dV 		
--- (3.25)
For one mole of gas,
PV = RT
∴ P dV= R dT, since pressure is constant.
Substituting in Eq. (3.25), we get
(CP – CV) dT = R dT
--- (3.26)
∴ CP – CV = R 			
This is known as Mayer’s relation
between CP and CV.
The above relation has been derived
assuming that the heat energy and mechanical
work are measured in the same units. Generally,
heat supplied is measured in calories and work
done is measured in joules. The above relation
then is modified to CP - CV = R/J where J is
mechanical equivalent of heat.
Also CP = M0SP and CV = M0SV, where
M0 is the molar mass of the gas and SP and
SV are respective principal specific heats. (In
many books, cP and cV are used to denote the
principal specific heats). Thus,
M0SP – M0SV = R/J
∴SP – SV =

R
M 0J

		

Example 3.3: Given the values of the
two principal specific heats, SP = 3400 cal
kg-1 K-1 and SV = 2400 cal kg-1 K-1 for the
hydrogen gas, find the value of J if the
universal gas constant R = 8300 J kg-1 K-1.
Solution: Given
SP = 3400 cal kg-1 K-1,
SV = 2400 cal kg-1 K-1,

Do you know?

vacuum, separated from each other, can

temperatures? If not, give reasons.
3.10
Absorption,
Reflection
and
Transmission of Heat Radiation:
In XIth Std. you have studied that heat can
be transferred by conduction, convection and
radiation. The first two modes of heat transfer
require a material medium for transmission
of heat but radiation does not need a material
medium. The most common example of heat
transfer by the radiation mode that we come
across every day is the transfer of heat and
light from the Sun to the earth and to us. In this
64

of heat incident is called the coefficient of
absorption.
Coefficient of reflection or reflectance
(r): The ratio of amount of radiant energy
reflected to the total energy incident is called
the coefficient of reflection.		
Coefficient of transmission or transmittance
(tr): The ratio of amount of radiant energy
transmitted to total energy incident is called
the coefficient of transmission.
Since all the three quantities a, r and
tr are ratios of thermal energies, they are
dimensionless quantities.
If r = 0 and a = 0, then tr = 1, all the incident
energy is transmitted through the object i.e., it
is a perfect transmitter. The object is said to be
completely transparent to the radiation.
A substance through which heat radiations
can pass is known as a diathermanous
substance. For a diathermanous body, tr ≠ 0.  A
diathermanous body is neither a good absorber
nor a good reflector.
Examples of diathermanous substances
are glass, quartz, sodium chloride, hydrogen,
oxygen, dry air etc.
On the other hand, if tr = 0 and a + r = 1,
i.e., the object does not transmit any radiation,
it is said to be opaque to the radiation.
Substances which are largely opaque to
thermal radiations i.e., do not transmit heat
radiations incident on them, are known as
athermanous substances.
Examples of athermanous substances are
water, wood, iron, copper, moist air, benzene
etc.
If tr = 0 and a = 0, then r = 1, all the
incident energy is reflected by the object i.e., it
is a perfect reflector. A good reflector is a poor
absorber and a poor transmitter.
If r = 0 and tr = 0 then a = 1, all the
incident energy is absorbed by the object. Such
an object is called a perfect blackbody. (We
will discuss this in detail later in this chapter)

section, we shall discuss radiation in detail.
As the term ‘radiation’ refers to one mode
of transfer of heat, the term ‘radiation’ also
refers to continuous emission of energy from
the surface of any body because of its thermal
energy. This emitted energy is termed as radiant
energy and is in the form of electromagnetic
waves. Radiation is therefore the fastest mode
of transfer of heat. The process of transfer of
heat by radiation does not require any material
medium since electromagnetic waves travel
through vacuum. Heat transfer by radiation
is therefore possible through vacuum as well
as through a material medium transparent to
this radiation. Physical contact of the bodies
that are exchanging heat is also not required.
When the radiation falls on a body that is not
transparent to it, e.g., on the floor or on our
hands, it is absorbed and the body gets heated
up. The electromagnetic radiation emitted by
the bodies, which are at higher temperature
with respect to the surroundings, is known as
thermal radiation.
3.10.1 Interaction of Thermal Radiation
and Matter:
Whenever thermal radiation falls on the
surface of an object, some part of heat energy
is reflected, some part is absorbed and the
remaining part is transmitted.
Let Q be the total amount of thermal
energy incident on the surface of an object
and Qa, Qr and Qt be the respective amounts
of heat absorbed, reflected and transmitted by
the object:

For the study of radiation, a simple
arrangement illustrated in Fig. 3.4, which was
designed by Ferry, can be used as a perfect
blackbody.
3.11.1 Ferry’s Blackbody:
It consists of a double walled hollow
sphere having tiny hole or aperture, through
which radiant heat can enter (Fig. 3.4). The
space between the walls is evacuated and
outer surface of the sphere is silvered. The
inner surface of sphere is coated with lampblack. There is a conical projection on the
inner surface of sphere opposite the aperture.
The projection ensures that a ray travelling
along the axis of the aperture is not incident
normally on the surface and is therefore not
reflected back along the same path. Radiation
entering through the small hole has negligible
chance of escaping back through the small
hole. A heat ray entering the sphere through
the aperture suffers multiple reflections and is
almost completely absorbed inside. Thus, the
aperture behaves like a perfect blackbody. In
a similar construction, Wien used a cylindrical
body with a vertical slit as the aperture.
This gives greater effective area as a perfect
blackbody.

The values of a, r and tr also depend on
the wavelength of the incident radiation, in
addition to the material of the object on which
it is incident. Hence, it is possible that an
object may be athermanous or diathermanous
for certain wavelengths, but is a good absorber
for certain other wavelengths.
3.11 Perfect Blackbody:
A body, which absorbs the entire radiant
energy incident on it, is called an ideal
or perfect blackbody. Thus, for a perfect
blackbody, a = 1. Any surface that absorbs all
the energy incident on it, and does not reflect
any energy, therefore, appears black (unless its
temperature is very high to be self-luminous).
Lamp black or platinum black that absorb
nearly 97% of incident radiant heat, resemble
a perfect blackbody.
Do you know?
•
•

Can a perfect blackbody be realized in
practice?
Are good absorbers also good emitters?

Consider two objects, which are opaque
to thermal radiation, having the same
temperature and same surface area. The
surface of one object is well-polished and the
surface of the other object is painted black.
The well-polished object reflects most of the
energy falling on it and absorbs little. On the
other hand, the black painted object absorbs
most of the radiation falling on it and reflects
little. But the rate of emission of thermal
radiation must be equal to rate of absorption
for both the objects, so that temperature is
maintained. Black painted object absorbs
more, hence it must radiate more to maintain
the temperature. Therefore, good absorbers are
always good emitters and poor absorbers are
poor emitters. Since each object must either
absorb or reflect the radiation incident on it, a
poor absorber should be a good reflector and
vice versa. Hence, a good reflector is also a
poor emitter. This is the reason for silvering
the walls of vacuum bottles or thermos flasks.

Fig. 3.4: Ferry’s blackbody.

Similar working can be achieved using
a cavity radiator that consists of a block of
material with internal cavity. The inner and
outer surfaces are connected by a small hole.
The radiation falling on the block that enters
through the hole, cannot escape back from it.
Hence, the cavity acts as a blackbody. When
66

from XIth Std. of a cup of hot tea (Ttea > Troom)
or a plate containing ice (Tice < Troom) kept
on a table, both attain the room temperature
after some time. At room temperature also, all
bodies radiate as well as absorb radiation, but
their rate of emission and rate of absorption
are same, hence their temperature remains
constant. You can therefore infer that hot
bodies would radiate more than cooler bodies.
At room temperature (in fact for
temperatures T lower than 800 ºC), the
thermal radiation corresponds to wavelengths
longer than those of visible light and hence
we do not see them. When the body is heated,
the radiated energy corresponds to shorter
wavelengths. For temperatures around
800 ºC, part of the energy emitted is in the
visible range and body appears red. At around
3000 ºC, it looks white hot. The filament
of a tungsten lamp appears white hot as its
temperature is around 3000 ºC
We have thus seen that all bodies
radiate electromagnetic radiation when their
temperature is above the absolute zero of
temperature.
Amount of heat radiated by a body
depends on
• The absolute temperature of the body (T)
• The nature of the body – the material,
nature of surface – polished or not, etc.
• Surface area of the body (A)
• Time duration of for which body emits
radiation (t)
The amount of heat radiated, Q, is
directly proportional to the surface area (A)
and time duration (t). It is therefore convenient
to consider the quantity of heat radiated per
unit area per unit time (or power emitted per
unit area). This is defined as emissive power
or radiant power, R, of the body, at a given
temperature T.

Dimensions of emissive power are
[LoM1T-3] and SI unit is J m-2 s-1 or W/m2.
The nature of emitting surface, i.e., its

the block is heated to high temperature, thermal
radiation is emitted. This is called cavity
radiation and resembles the radiation emitted
by a blackbody. Its nature depends only on the
temperature of the cavity walls and not on the
shape and size of the cavity or the material of
the cavity walls. In the kinetic theory of gases,
we discussed the theory, properties and various
phenomena of an ideal gas rather than dealing
with real gases, similarly it is convenient to
work with an ideal blackbody.
3.12 Emission of Heat Radiation :
In 1792, Pierre Prevost published a theory
of radiation known as theory of exchange of
heat. According to this theory, all bodies at
all temperatures above 0 K (absolute zero
temperature) radiate thermal energy and at
the same time, they absorb radiation received
from the surroundings. The amount of thermal
radiation emitted per unit time depends on
the nature of emitting surface, its area and its
temperature. Hotter bodies radiate at higher
rate than the cooler bodies. Light coloured
bodies reflect most of the visible radiation
whereas dark coloured bodies absorb most of
the incident visible radiation.
For a body, the absorbed radiation
(being energy) increases the kinetic energy
of the constituent atoms oscillating about
their mean positions. You have learnt earlier
that the average translational kinetic energy
determines the temperature of the body, the
absorbed radiation therefore causes a rise in
the temperature of the body. The body itself
also radiates, therefore its energy decreases,
causing lowering of temperature. If a body
radiates more than it absorbs, its temperature
decreases and vice versa. When the rate of
absorption of radiation is same as the rate
of emission of radiation, the temperature
of the body remains constant and the body
is said to be in thermal equilibrium with its
surroundings. You might recall the example

material or polishing is not a physical quantity.
Hence, to discuss the material aspect, we
compare objects of different materials with
identical geometries at the same temperature.
At a given temperature, a perfect blackbody
has maximum emissive power. Thus it is
convenient to compare emissive power of a
given surface with that of the perfect blackbody
at the same temperature.
3.12.1 Coefficient of Emission or Emissivity:
The coefficient of emission or emissivity
(e) of a given surface is the ratio of the emissive
power R of the surface to the emissive power
RB of a perfect black surface, at the same
temperature.

3.13 Kirchhoff’s Law of Heat Radiation and
its Theoretical Proof:
Kirchhoff’s law of thermal radiation
deals with wavelength specific radiative
emission and absorption by a body in
thermal equilibrium. It states that at a given
temperature, the ratio of emissive power to
coefficient of absorption of a body is equal to
the emissive power of a perfect blackbody at
the same temperature for all wavelengths.
Since we can describe the emissive power
of an ordinary body in comparison to a perfect
blackbody through its emissivity, Kirchhoff’s
law can also be stated as follows: for a body
emitting and absorbing thermal radiation in
thermal equilibrium, the emissivity is equal to
its absorptivity.
Symbolically, a = e or more specifically
a(λ) = e(λ).
Thus, if a body has high emissive power,
it also has high absorptive power and if a
body has low emissive power, it also has low
absorptive power.
Kirchhoff’s law can be theoretically
proved by the following thought experiment.
Consider an ordinary body A and a perfect
blackbody B of identical geometric shapes
placed in an enclosure. In thermal equilibrium,
both bodies will be at same temperature as that
of the enclosure.
Let R be the emissive power of body A,
RB be the emissive power of blackbody B and
a be the coefficient of absorption of body A.
If Q is the quantity of radiant heat incident on
each body in unit time and Qa is the quantity
of radiant heat absorbed by the body A, then
Qa = a Q. As the temperatures of the body A
and blackbody B remain the same, both must
emit the same amount as they absorb in unit
time. Since emissive power is the quantity of
heat radiated from unit area in unit time, we
can write
Quantity of radiant heat absorbed by
body A= Quantity of heat emitted by body A

Why are the bottoms of cooking utensils

A car is left in sunlight with all its
windows closed on a hot day. After
some time it is observed that the inside
of the car is warmer than outside air.
Why?
If surfaces of all bodies are continuously
emitting radiant energy, why do they
not cool down to 0 K?

Everyday objects are not ideal
blackbodies. Hence, they radiate at a rate
less then that of the blackbody at the same
temperature. Also for these objects, the rate
does depend on properties such as the colour
and composition of the surface, in addition
to the temperature. All these effects together
are taken care of in the term emissivity e. For
an ordinary body, 0 < e < 1 depending on the
nature of the surface, e.g., emissivity of copper
is 0.3. Emissivity is larger for rough surfaces
and smaller for smooth and polished surfaces.
Emissivity also varies with temperature and
wavelength of radiation to some extent.

law in daily life?
3.14 Spectral Distribution of Blackbody
Radiation:
The radiant energy emitted per unit
area per unit time by a blackbody depends
on its temperature. Hot objects radiate
electromagnetic radiation in a large range of
frequencies. Hence, the rate of emission per
unit area or power per unit area of a surface
is defined as a funtion of the wavelength λ of
the emitted radiation. At low temperature, the
power radiated is small and primarily lies in
the long wavelength region. As the temperature
is increased, rate of emission increases fast. At
each temperature, the radiant energy contains
a mixture of different wavelengths. At higher
temperatures, the total energy radiated per
unit time increases and the proportion of
energy emitted at higher frequencies or shorter
wavelengths also increases.
Lummer and Pringsheim studied the
energy distribution of blackbody radiation as a
function of wavelength. They kept the source of
radiation (such as a cavity radiator) at different
temperatures and measured the radiant power
corresponding to different wavelengths. The
measurements were represented graphically
in the form of curves showing variation of
radiant power per unit area as a function
of wavelength λ at different constant
temperatures as shown in Fig. 3.5. Spectral
distribution of power radiated by a body

Fig. 3.5: Radiant power of a blackbody per unit
range of wavelength as a function of wavelength.

From experimental curves, it is observed
that
1. at a given temperature, the energy is not
uniformly distributed in the spectrum (i.e.,
as a function of wavelength) of blackbody,
2. at a given temperature, the radiant power
emitted initially increases with increase of
wavelength, reaches it’s maximum and then
decreases. The wavelength corresponding
to the radiation of maximum intensity,
λmax , is characteristic of the temperature
of the radiating body. (Remember, it is not
the maximum wavelength emitted by the
object),
3. area under the curve represents total energy
emitted per unit time per unit area by the
blackbody at all wavelengths,
4. the peak of the curves shifts towards
the left – shorter wavelengths, i.e., the
value of λmax decreases with increase in
temperature,
5. at higher temperatures, the radiant power
or total energy emitted per unit time per
unit area (i.e., the area under the curve)
69

corresponding to all the wavelengths
increases,
6. at a temperature of 300 K (around room
temperature), the most intense of these
waves has a wavelength of about 5 ×
10-6 m; the radiant power is smaller for
wavelengths different from this value.
Practically all the radiant energy at this
temperature is carried by waves longer
than those corresponding to red light.
These are infrared radiations.
A theoretical explanation of the above
observations could not be given by the then
existing theories. Wien gave an expression
for spectral distribution from laws of
thermodynamics, which fitted the experimental
observations only for short wavelengths. Lord
Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans gave a formula
from the equipartition of energy. This formula
fits well in the long wavelength regions but
tends to infinity at short wavelengths. It was
therefore essential to propose a new model to
explain the behaviour of blackbody. Planck,
being aware of the shortcomings of the two
models, combined the two models using an
empirical formula and could describe the
observed spectrum quite well.

energy to another of lower energy. As long
as the oscillator is in one of the quantized
states, it does not emit or absorb energy.
This model of Planck turned out to be the
basis for Einstein’s theory to explain the
observations of experiments on photoelectric
effect, as you will learn in Chapter 14.
3.14.1 Wien’s Displacement Law :
It is observed that the wavelength, for
which emissive power of a blackbody is
maximum, is inversely proportional to the
absolute temperature of the blackbody. This is
Wien’s displacement law.

where b is called the Wien’s constant and its
value is 2.897 × 10-3 m K. λmax indicates the
wavelength at which the blackbody dominantly
radiates. Thus, it corresponds to the dominant
colour of the radiating body and is a function
of its temperature. You might have heard of
white dwarfs and red giants, white dwarfs are
hot stars with surface temperature ~ 10000 K
while red giants are cooler corresponding to
surface temperature ~ 3000 K.
This law is useful to determine
temperatures of distant stars, Sun, moon etc.

Do you know?
The idea of quantization of energy
was first proposed by Planck to explain
the blackbody spectrum or the cavity
radiations. Planck proposed a model in
terms of the atomic processes. He considered
the atoms of the walls of the cavity as
tiny electromagnetic oscillators with
characteristic frequencies that exchange
energy with the cavity. This energy was
supposed to have only specific values
E = nhν, where ν is the frequency of
oscillator, h is a universal constant that
has a value 6.626 × 10-34 J s and n can take
only positive integral values. The oscillators
would not radiate energy continuously but
only in “jumps” or “quanta” corresponding
to transitions from one quantized level of

in thermal energy of the body per unit area per

Since the loss or gain of energy per unit
area per unit time is proportional to the fourth
power of absolute temperature, this law is very
significant in deciding the thermal equilibrium
of physical systems. If the absolute temperature
of a body is doubled, the power radiated will
increase by a factor of 24 = 16. Or if a body
radiates with some rate at room temperature
(300 K), the rate will double even if we increase
the temperature of the body by 57 ºC.

Can you tell?
λmax, the wavelength corresponding to
maximum intensity for the Sun is in the
blue-green region of visible spectrum. Why
does the Sun then appear yellow to us?
3.15 Stefan-Boltzmann Law of Radiation:
We shall now discuss the temperature
dependence of thermal radiation emitted per
unit time by a blackbody. In 1879, Josef Stefan
proposed an empirical relation between the rate
at which heat is radiated (the radiant power
R) from unit area of a perfect blackbody and
its temperature T, based on the experimental
observations. Five years later, Boltzmann
derived the relation using thermodynamics.
Hence it is known as Stefan-Boltzmann law.
According to this law,“The rate of emission
of radiant energy per unit area or the power
radiated per unit area of a perfect blackbody is
directly proportional to the fourth power of its
absolute temperature”.

where σ is Stefan’s constant and is equal

to 5.67 × 10 J m-2 s-1 K-4 or W m-2 K-4 and
dimensions of σ are [L0M1T-3K-4].
Thus, the power radiated by a perfect
blackbody depends only on its temperature
and not on any other characteristics such as
colour, materials, nature of surface etc.

4. Thermodynamics
Can you recall?

was large enough to boil water. A very
important observation was that the amount of
heat produced was related to the work done
in turning the drill that was used to bore the
canon. It was also noticed that more heat was
produced when the drill bored for a longer
time. It did not depend on the sharpness of the
drills used. A sharper drill would have removed
more heat according to the older theory of heat,
which assumed heat to be some form of a fluid.
This observation could be explained only if
heat was a form of energy and not any fluid. It
is natural to conclude from these observations
that energy can be converted from one form
to another form. In this particular case, a very
important law of physics can be proposed that,
‘the work done by a system is converted into
heat’. (The drills used to bore the canons ‘do’
the work and the canons get heated up).
This was, probably, one of the
pioneer experiments in thermodynamics.
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that
deals with the concepts of heat and temperature
and the inter-conversion of heat and other
forms of energy.

1. When a piece of ice is placed in water
at room temperature, the ice melts
and water cools down. Why does their
temperature change?
2. When water boils, why does its
temperature remains constant?
3. When an inflated balloon is suddenly
burst, why is the emerging air slightly
cooled?
4.1 Introduction:
In XIth Std. we have studied thermal
properties of matter. In this chapter, we shall
study the laws that govern the behavior of
thermal energy. We shall study the processes
where work is converted into heat and vice
versa.
When we drive a vehicle, its engine gets
warmer after some time. Similarly, when we
exercise, we also feel warmth in our body.
Similar physics is involved in both the cases.
The engine of a vehicle as well as our muscles
do some work and both produce some heat. It
is, therefore, natural to think that if the work
done by an engine or our muscles produces
some heat then heat should also be able to
‘do’ some work. Thermodynamics is mostly
the study of conversion of work (or any form
of energy) into heat and the other way round.
When a hot object is in contact with a
cold object, we notice that both objects reach
the same temperature after some time. The hot
object gets cooler and the cold object becomes
warmer. That means something is exchanged
between the two objects. This ‘something’ is
heat. According to modern theory, heat is a
form of energy.
In the year 1798 it was observed by
Benjamin Thomson, a British scientist, that
tremendous heat is produced when brass
canons were bored. The heat thus produced

It is the field of study that allows us to
understand nature of many of the fundamental
interactions in the universe. It can explain
phenomena as simple as water boiling in a
vessel, and also something as complex as the
creation of a new star. Thermodynamics is
an important branch of physics having many
practical applications.
In this chapter we will try to understand
a thermodynamic system, thermodynamic
variables, thermodynamic processes and the
laws that govern these processes. We will
also study the most important and useful
applications of thermodynamics, the heat
engines and their efficiency.
75

4.2 Thermal Equilibrium:
The thermal properties of materials
discussed in XIth Std. are useful to understand
the behaviour of a material when it is heated
or cooled. When you put a piece of ice in
water at room temperature, the ice melts. This
is because the water at room temperature
(higher than the ice temperature) transfers
its heat to ice and helps ice melt. Similarly,
when hot water is mixed with cold water, it
transfers its heat to the cold water. The hot
water cools down. In both these examples, we
notice that the two components reach a stage
where there is no more transfer of heat. In such
cases, we assume that heat is something that
is transferred from a substance at a higher
temperature to that at a lower temperature.
This transfer continues till the level of heat
content in both the substances is the same. Then
we say that a thermal equilibrium is reached
between the two substances. We can say that
when two objects are at the same temperature,
they are in thermal equilibrium. This concept
of thermal equilibrium is used in the Zeroth
Law of thermodynamics. It is called the Zeroth
Law because it was proposed after the First
and the Second laws of thermodynamics were
formulated.

''If two systems are each in thermal
equilibrium with a third system, they are also
in thermal equilibrium with each other''.

Fig. 4.1: Schematic representation of Zeroth
law of thermodynamics.

Figure
4.1 shows a schematic
representation of the Zeroth law of
thermodynamics. The double arrow represents
thermal equilibrium between systems. If
system A and C are in thermal equilibrium, and
systems A and B are in thermal equilibrium,
then systems B and C must be in thermal
equilibrium. Then systems A, B and C are at
the same temperature.
For example, when we use a thermometer
to measure temperature of an object, we use
the same principle. When the thermometer
and the object are in thermal equilibrium, the
thermometer indicates the temperature of the
object. The zeroth law, therefore, enables us to
use a thermometer to compare the temperatures
of different objects. This is schematically
shown in the Fig 4.2. It also implies that
temperature is a measurable quantity. The
science of measuring temperatures is called
Thermometry which involves different
temperature scales and methods of measuring
temperature. This is already discussed in XIth
Std.

Remember this
Thermal equilibrium: Two systems in
thermal contact with each other are in
thermal equilibrium if they do not transfer
heat between each other.
Can you tell?
Why different objects kept on a table at
room temperature do not exchange heat
with the table?
4.3 Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics:
The Zeroth law is very important as it
helps us to define the concept of a temperature
scale. The formal statement of the Zeroth law
of thermodynamics is as follows:

Fig. 4.2: Concept of temperature measurement.

Remember this
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
states that systems in thermal equilibrium
are at the same temperature.
76

kinetic energy of the atoms having a linear
motion. (Discussed in Chapter 3). For a
polyatomic gas such as carbon di-oxide,
we consider the rotational and vibrational
kinetic energy of the molecules in addition
to their translational kinetic energy. In case
of liquids and solids, we need to consider the
potential energy of the molecules due to the
intermolecular attractive forces amongst them.
Remember this is again at the molecular level
(microscopic scale) only. This internal energy
of a system is denoted by U .

Can you tell?
Why is it necessary to make a physical
contact between a thermocouple and the
object for measuring its temperature?
4.4 Heat, Internal Energy and Work:
Earlier in this chapter, we saw that
when two substances, initially at different
temperatures, are brought in contact with each
other, the substance at higher temperature loses
its heat and the substance at lower temperature
gains it. We did not discuss the reasons why
any substances can ‘have’ that heat and what
exactly is the nature of the heat content of that
substance. The examples we discussed in the
previous section and in chapter 7 (XIth Std.),
help us understand the transfer of heat from
one body to the other. But they do not help us
in explaining why the action of rubbing our
palms together generates warmth, or why an
engine gets warmer when it is running. These
and similar phenomena can be explained on
the basis of the concept of the internal energy
of a system, the conversion of work and heat
into each other and the laws governing these
inter conversions.

Example 4.1: Calculate the internal energy
of argon and oxygen.
Solution: Arogon is a monatomic gas.
Internal energy of a gas depends only on
its temperature. Hence, its internal energy
is given by 3/2 kT. Oxygen is a dia-atomic
gas its internal energy is 5/2 kT.
4.4.2
Thermodynamic
Thermodynamic Process:

4.4.1 Internal Energy:
We know that every system (large
or small) consists of a large number of
molecules. Internal energy is defined as
the energy associated with the random,
disordered motion of the molecules of a system.
It is different than the macroscopic ordered
energy of a moving object. For example, a
glass of water kept on a table has no kinetic
energy because it is not moving. Its potential
energy can also be taken as zero. But we
know, from the kinetic theory, that the water
molecules in the glass at the given temperature
move at a random speed. Thus, we can say
that, the internal energy of a substance is the
total energy of all its atoms/molecules.
For an ideal monatomic gas such as argon,
the internal energy is just the translational

system

and

Figure 4.3 (a): a system, its boundary and
environment.

Let us understand what is meant by a
thermodynamic system and a thermodynamic
process first.
A thermodynamic system is a collection
or a group of objects that can form a unit which
may have ability to exchange energy with its
surroundings. Anything that is not a part of the
system is its surrounding or its environment.
For example, water kept in a vessel is a system,
the vessel is its boundary and the atmosphere
around it is its surrounding. Figure 4.3 (a)
shows this schematically.
Thermodynamic systems can be classified
on the basis of the possible transfer of heat and
matter to environment. Based on this, they are
77

the water inside the vessel change when it
starts boiling. Thus, we can describe the state
of a system by using temperature, pressure and
volume as its variables. We will discuss these
in some details at a later stage in section 4.5.1.
4.4.3 Heat:
Let us now try to understand heat and its
relation with the internal energy of a system.
Consider a glass filled with water on a table.
The glass, along with the water in it forms a
system. Let the temperature of this system be
TS . The table on which the glass is kept and
the other relevant parts of the room will then
be its surrounding or the environment. Let the
temperature of the environment be TE . We
notice that if TS and TE are not the same, then
TS will change until both the temperatures are
equal and a thermal equilibrium will be reached
between the ‘system’ and the ‘environment’.
TS will also change to some extent, but the end
result is that the ‘system’ and the ‘environment’
reach thermal equilibrium. If the environment
is very large, the change in TE may not be
measurable, but certainly not zero.
Such a change in temperature is caused
by the transfer of internal energy between the
system and its environment. In this case, the
transfer of energy is between the glass of water
and its surrounding.

classified as open, closed or isolated systems.
An open system is a system that freely
allows exchange of energy and matter with its
environment. For example, water boiling in a
kettle is an open system. Heat escapes into the
air. This is the exchange of energy with the
surroundings. At the same time, steam also
escapes into the air. This is exchange of matter
with the surroundings.
A closed system, on the other hand, does
not allow the exchange of matter but allows
energy to be transferred. For example, water
boiling in a boiler is a closed system. It allows
heat (energy) to be transferred from the source
of heat (a burner) to the water (system) inside.
Similarly, heat is also transferred to the
surroundings. Steam (matter) is not allowed to
escape as long as the valve is kept closed.
An isolated system is completely sealed
(isolated from its environment). Matter as
well as heat cannot be exchanged with its
environment. A thermos flask is a very familiar
example of an isolated system.
Figure 4.3 (b) shows an open system,
a closed system, and an isolated system
schematically.

Remember this
When transfer of energy takes place
between a system and its environment, we
observe the following conventions.
1. When the energy is transferred to
a system from its environment, it
is positive. We say that the system gains
(or absorbs) energy.
2. When the energy is transferred from
the system to its environment, it
is negative. We say that the system
loses (or releases) energy.

Figure 4.3 (b): Thermodynamic systems; open
system, closed system, and isolated system.

A thermodynamic process is a process in
which the thermodynamic state of a system is
changed. For example, water contained in a
vessel with a lid on it is an open system. When
the pot is heated externally, water starts boiling
after some time and steam is produced which
exerts pressure on the walls of the vessel. In
this case, the state of the water in the container
is changed. This is because, the temperature
(T ), the volume (V ), and the pressure (P ) of
78

some gas in it. This cylinder is provided with
a movable, massless, and frictionless piston at
one end as shown. The gas inside the cylinder
is our system and the rest is its environment.
Let the temperature of the gas be TS and that
of the environment be TE.
Internal energy of the system (the gas) can
be changed in two different ways or by both.

Fig. 4.4 (a): Energy flows into the system.

Consider Fig. 4.4 which shows energy
transfer between a system and its environment.
Let TS and TE be the temperatures of the system
and its environment respectively. Let Q be the
energy transferred between the system and
its environment. As shown in Fig. 4.4 (a),
TS > TE , the system gains energy, and Q is
positive.

Fig. 4.4 (b): Energy flows from the system.
Fig. 4.5: (a) Change in internal energy of a system
can be brought about by heating the system.

In Fig. 4.4 (b), TS < TE the system loses
energy, and Q is negative. In Fig.4.4 (c),
TS = TE , the system and the environment are in
thermal equilibrium and there is no transfer of
energy (Q = 0).

i) The cylinder can be brought in contact with
a source of heat such as a burner as shown
in Fig. 4.5.(a). As discussed previously, the
temperature difference between the source of
heat (environment) and the system will cause
a flow of energy (heat) towards the gas in the
cylinder. This is because TE > TS . Thus, there
will be an increase in the internal energy of
the gas. Such exchange of energy is possible
in another way also. If the surrounding is at
temperature lower than the gas, TS > TE , the
gas will lose energy to its environment and
cool down.

Fig. 4.4 (c): No transfer energy.

Using these observations, we can now
define heat as the energy that is transferred
(between the system and its environment) due
to a temperature difference that exists between
the two. It is denoted by Q .
4.4.4 Change in Internal Energy of a System:
In the previous discussion we have seen
that the internal energy of a system can be
changed (it can be gained or released) due to
exchange with its environment. Now we will
try to understand how this transfer of energy
between a system and its environment is
possible. Consider the following experiment.
Figure 4.5 (a) shows a cylinder filled with

Fig. 4.5: (b) Change in internal energy of a system
can be brought about by doing some work on it.

ii) The other way to increase the internal energy
of the gas is to quickly push the piston inside
the cylinder, so that the gas is compressed, as
79

4.5.1 First Law of Thermodynamics
Consider a very common thermodynamic
system which consists of some quantity of an
ideal gas enclosed in a cylinder with a movable,
massless, and frictionless piston. Figure 4.6
shows such arrangement. In this, the gas inside
the cylinder is the system and the cylinder
along with the piston is its environment.
At this stage, we will tentatively base
our discussion on the basis of the kinetic
theory, that is, the microscopic description of
a system. It is important to keep in mind that
a thermodynamic system can be completely
described on the basis of the macroscopic model.
(We will discuss it briefly at a later stage).

shown in Fig. 4.5.(b). In this case, we know
that the piston does some work on the gas in
moving it through some distance. The gas
gains energy and its temperature is increased.
On the other hand, if the gas pushes the piston
out, so that the gas is expanded, some work is
done by the gas. It loses some of its energy and
the gas cools down.
Use your brain power
Why is there a change in the energy of a gas
when its volume changes?
Thus, we see that the internal energy
of a system can be changed in two different
ways, 1) by heating it or 2) by doing work on
it. The experiment we discussed just now can
be carried out in a very meticulous way so that
we achieve the same change in temperature of
the gas by both the methods.
Conclusion of this experiment leads us to
a very important principle of thermodynamics.
It is related to the work done on the system
(or, by the system) and the change in the
internal energy of the system. Both are related
through the energy that is transferred to (or,
by) the system and the heat that is involved in
the process. This leads us to the First Law of
Thermodynamics.

Fig. 4.6 (a): Positive work done by a system.

First, consider the work done by the
system (the gas) in increasing the volume of
the cylinder. During expansion, (Fig.4.6 (a))
the gas molecules which strike the piston lose
their momentum to it, and exert a pressure
on it. As a result, the piston moves through a
finite distance. The gas does a positive work on
the piston. When the piston is pushed in so that
the volume of the gas decreases, (Fig.4.6 (b))
the gas molecules striking it gain momentum
from the piston. The gas does a negative work
on the piston.

Can you recall?
During the middle of nineteenth century,
James Joule showed that mechanical work
done and the heat produced while doing
that work are equivalent. This equivalence
is the mechanical equivalent of heat. The
relation between the mechanical work W
and the corresponding heat produced H is
W = J × H. The constant J is the mechanical
equivalent of heat.
4.5 First Law of Thermodynamics: (Work
and Heat are related)
The first law of thermodynamics gives the
mathematical relation between heat and work.

Fig. 4.6 (b): Negative work done by a system.

Consider Fig. 4.7 which shows a system
enclosed in a cylinder with a movable,
massless, and frictionless piston so that its

work from it). Equation (4.2) gives the amount
of work done in changing the volume of a
system.
When the amount of heat Q is added to
the system and the system does not do any
work during the process, its internal energy
increases by the amount, ∆U = Q. On the other
hand, when the system does some work to
increase its volume, and no heat is added to it
while expanding, the system loses energy to its
surrounding and its internal energy decreases.
This means that when W is positive, ∆U is
negative and, vice versa. Therefore, we can
write, ∆U = - W.
In practice, the internal energy can change
by both the ways. Therefore, we consider
the effect of both together and write the total
change in the internal energy as,
∆U = Q -W
		
--- (4.3)
This is the mathematical statement of the
first law of thermodynamics. This equation
tells that the change in the internal energy of
a system is the difference between the heat
supplied to the system and the work done by
the system on its surroundings.
We can rearrange the Eq. (4.3) and write,
Q = ∆U +W
--- (4.4)
This is also the first law of thermodynamics.
Both forms of the law are used while studying
a system. Equation (4.4) means that when the
amount of heat Q is added to a system, its
internal energy is increased by an amount ∆U
and the remaining is lost in the form of work
done W on the surrounding.

volume can change. Let the cross sectional
area of the cylinder (and the piston) be A, and
the constant pressure exerted by the system
on the piston be p. The total force exerted by

Force that system exerts on piston

the system on the piston will be F = pA. If
the piston moves through an infinitesimal (very
small) distance dx, the work done by this force is,
dW = pdV
But Adx = dV, the infinitesimal change
in the volume of the cylinder. Hence, the
work done by the system in bringing out this
infinitesimal change in the volume can be
written as,
		dW = pdV
--- (4.1)
If the initial volume of the cylinder is
Vi and its volume after some finite change is
Vf , then the total work done in changing the
volume of the cylinder is,
Vf

The change in volume in this case is small.
Example 4.2 : A gas enclosed in a cylinder
is expanded to double its initial volume at a
constant pressure of one atmosphere. How
much work is done in this process?.
Solution : Given: Pressure of one atmosphere
p = 1.01× 105 Pa, change in volume
(Vf - Vi) = 0.5.

Can you tell?
Can you explain the thermodynamics
involved in cooking food using a pressure
cooker?

W = p (Vf - Vi) = 1.01 × 10 (+ 0.5)
= 0.505 × 105 = 5.05 × 105 J
Is this work done on the gas or by the gas?
How do you know this?

Example 4.3 : 1.0 kg of liquid water is

a system can be changed either by providing
some heat to it (or, by removing heat from it)

during this change, and (c) the change
in the internal energy of the system.
Given, the volume of water changes from
1.0 × 10-3 m3 in liquid form to 1.671 m3

to steam by absorbing the heat of
vaporization. In case of water, this is

(b) The work done can be calculated by
using Eq. (4.1). Here, the pressure is
1.01×105 Pa and the change in volume is
dV = (1.671 m3 - 1.0x10-3 m3)
The work done is,
W = pdV = (1.01×105Pa) × (1.671 m3
-1.0x10-3 m3)
= 1.69x105 J = 169kJ
(c) Change in the internal energy of the
system can be calculated by using Eq. (4.3).
∆U = Q - W
= 2265 kJ - 169 kJ = 2096 kJ
This energy is positive which means
that there is an increase in the internal
energy of water when it boils. This energy
is used to separate water molecules from
each other which are closer in liquid water
than in water in vapour form.
Can you explain how the work done
by the system is utilized?

Fig. 4.8 (b): Decrease in internal energy
(∆U < 0)

shows the case when more work is done by the
system than the heat added to it. In this case,
the internal energy of the system decreases,
(∆U < 0). Figure 4.8.(c) shows the case when
heat added to the system and the work done
by it are the same. The internal energy of the
system remains unchanged, (∆U = 0).

Fig. 4.8 (c): No change in internal energy
(∆U = 0)

The law of conservation of energy we
studied in XIth Std. was applicable to an
isolated system, i.e., to a system in which there
is no exchange of energy. The first law of
thermodynamics, Eq. (4.3) and Eq. (4.4) is an
extension of the law of conservation of energy
to systems which are not isolated, i.e., systems
that can exchange energy. This exchange can
be in the form of work W, or heat Q. The first
law of thermodynamics is thus a generalization
of the law of conservation of energy.
We started this discussion on the basis
of the microscopic view (kinetic theory) of
internal energy. In practice, this is not useful
because it does not help us in calculating the
internal energy of a system. In physics, we
need some measurable quantities so that the
internal energy of a system can be measured,
though indirectly. Equation (4.3), ∆U Q - W,
provides this method. The internal energy

The quantities W and Q can be positive,
negative or zero, therefore, ∆U can be positive,
negative, or zero. Figure 4.8 shows these three
cases. Figure 4.8. (a) shows the case when

Property of a system or a system variable:
It is any measurable or observable
characteristic or property of a system when
the system remains in equilibrium. A property
is also called a state variable of the system.
We will use the term variable to describe
characteristic of a system. For example,
pressure, volume, temperature, density and
mass of a system are some of the variables
that are used to describe a system. These
are measurable properties and are called
macroscopic variables of a system.
Intensive and Extensive variables:
Intensive variables do not depend on the
size of the system. Extensive variables depend
on the size of the system. Consider a system
in equilibrium. Let this system be divided into
two equal compartments, each with half the
original volume. We notice that the pressure
p, the temperature T, and the density ρ are
the same in both compartments. These are
intensive variables. The total mass M, and the
internal energy U of the system are equally
divided in the two compartments and are
extensive variables of the system.
4.6.1 Thermodynamic Equilibrium:
A system is in thermodynamic equilibrium
if the following three conditions of equilibrium
are satisfied simultaneously. These are,
1) Mechanical equilibrium, 2) Chemical
equilibrium, and 3) Thermal equilibrium.
1) Mechanical equilibrium: When there are
no unbalanced forces within the system and
between the system and its surrounding, the
system is said to be in mechanical equilibrium.
The system is also said to be in mechanical
equilibrium when the pressure throughout
the system and between the system and its
surrounding is the same. Whenever some
unbalanced forces exist within the system,
they will get neutralized with time to attain
the condition of equilibrium. A system is in
mechanical equilibrium when the pressure in
it is the sane throughout and does not change
with time.

appears as the difference between the heat Q
supplied to (or released by) the system and
the work W done by (or done on) the system.
Both are measurable quantities. In physics,
we generally discuss volume expansion of a
gas when heat is added to it. In this case, the
heat added and the resulting expansion of the
gas can be measured. The expansion of a gas
to do work in moving a piston in an internal
combustion engine can also be measured.
Example 4.4: 104 kJ of work is done on
certain volume of a gas. If the gas releases
125 kJ of heat, calculate the change in
internal energy (in kJ) of the gas.
Solution: We know from the first law of
thermodynamics that ∆U = Q - W
Given, W = 104 kJ. This work is done on
the gas, hence we write W = - 104 kJ.
Similarly, the heat is released by the gas
and we write Q = - 125 kJ.
Therefore, from the first law of
thermodynamics, we have,
∆U = |Q| - |W|
∴ ∆U = (125 - 104) = 21 kJ
Remember this
The first law of thermodynamics gives the
relationship between the heat transfer, the
work done, and the change in the internal
energy of a system.
4.6 Thermodynamic state variables
Earlier, we have discussed thermal
equilibrium and understood the concept
of temperature and the Zeroth law of
thermodynamics. Thermodynamics is not
the study of changes in temperature of a
system only. As we have seen earlier, when
temperature of a system changes (it gains or
releases energy), its other properties can also
change. Let us understand these properties.
We will define the term property of a
thermodynamic system first.
83

2) Chemical equilibrium: A system is said to
be in chemical equilibrium when there are no
chemical reactions going on within the system,
or there is no transfer of matter from one part
of the system to the other due to diffusion. A
system is in chemical equilibrium when its
chemical composition is the sane throughout
and does not change with time.
3) Thermal equilibrium: When the
temperature of a system is uniform throughout
and does not change with time, the system is
said to be in thermal equilibrium. We have
discussed thermal equilibrium at length earlier.

air may not be uniform throughout. Similarly,
the fuel (a mixture of petrol vapour) in the
cylinder of an automobile engine undergoing
an explosive chemical reaction when ignited
by a spark is not an equilibrium state. This
is because its temperature and pressure are
not uniform. Such system which is not in
equilibrium cannot be described in terms of
the state variables. Eventually, the air in first
case, and the fuel in the second case reach a
uniform temperature and pressure and attain
thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its
surroundings. Thus it attains thermodynamic
equilibrium.
In simple words, thermodynamic state
variables describe the equilibrium states
of a system. The various state variables
are not always independent. They can be
mathematically related. The mathematical
relation between the state variables is called
the equation of state. For example, for an
ideal gas, the equation of state is the ideal gas
equation,
pV = nRT 		
--- (4.5)
Where, p, V and T are the pressure, the volume
and the temperature of the gas, n is the number
of moles of the gas and R is the gas constant.
For a fixed amount of the gas, i.e., for given n,
there are thus, only two independent variables.
It could be p and V, or p and T, or V and T.

them in to one of the categories we just
discussed.
4.6.2 Thermodynamic State Variables and
Equation of State
Every
equilibrium
state
of
a
thermodynamic system is completely described
by specific values of some macroscopic
variables, also called state variables. For
example, an equilibrium state of a gas is
completely described by the values of its
pressure p, volume V, temperature T, and mass
m. Consider a mixture of gases or vapours as
in case of the fuel in an automobile engine. Its
state can be described by the state variables
but we also need its composition to describe
its state.

Fig. 4.9: Non equilibrium state.

Fig. 4.10: A typical p-V diagram.

A thermodynamic system is not always in
equilibrium. Figure 4.9 shows such case. For
example, when an inflated ball is punctured,
the air inside it suddenly expands to the
atmosphere. This is not an equilibrium state.
During the rapid expansion, pressure of the

The graphical representation of equation
of state of a system (of a gas) is called the
p - V diagram, or the p - V curve (the pressure
– volume curve), or the indicator diagram of
the system. Figure 4.10 shows a typical p-V
diagram for an ideal gas at some constant
84

temperature. The pressure-volume curve for
a constant temperature is called an isotherm.
Real gases may have more complicated
equations of state and therefore, a complicated
p-V diagram. (The Van-der–Wall’s equation
with various corrections for example, is
complicated for a real gas and is equally
interesting). The equation of state of a system
(usually a gas confined to a cylinder with a
movable, frictionless and massless piston) and
its p - V diagram are very useful in studying
its behavior. In the following sections, we will
discuss some systems and their behavior using
p - V diagrams.
4.6.3 The p - V diagram:
Consider Eq. (4.2), i.e.,

decreases. The work done by the gas in this
case is positive because the volume of the gas
has increased.
Similarly, Fig. 4.11 (b) shows compression
due to inward displacement of the piston. The
pressure of the gas is increased and the work
done by the gas is now negative.

 pdV

The integral in this equation can be
evaluated if we know the relation between
the pressure p and the volume V, or the path
between the limits of integration. Equation.
(4.2) can be represented graphically.

Fig. 4.11 (b): Negative work with varying
pressure.

A gas confined to a cylinder with a
movable, frictionless, and massless piston can
be, 1) expanded with varying pressure (Figure
4.11 a), or 2) it can be compressed with varying
pressure Fig. 4.11 (b), or 3) it can expand at
constant pressure Fig. 4.11 (c).
The area under the curve in the p-V
diagram, is the graphical representation of the
value of the integral in Eq. (4.2). Since this
integral represents the work done in changing
the volume of the gas, the area under the p-V
curve also represents the work done in this
process.

Figure 4.11 (c) shows the p-V diagram
when the volume of the gas changes from
Vi to Vf at a constant pressure. The curve is
actually a line parallel to the volume axis. The
work done during volume change at constant
pressure is W = p (Vf - Vi ), (Only in this case
the integration is p (dV)).

When the volume is constant in any
thermodynamic process, the work done is
zero because there is no displacement. These

by the point B with its coordinates given by
(Vf , pf). The curve 1 (path 1) shown in the
Fig. 4.12 (a) is one of the many ways (paths) in
which we can change the system from state A
to the state B. When the system changes itself
from A to B along the path 1, both its pressure
and volume change. The pressure decreases
while the volume increases. The work done
by the system is positive (because the volume
increases). It is given by the area under the
curve 1 as shown in the Fig. 4.12 (b).

changes are very slow. We will discuss such
processes in some details in a later section.
4.7 Thermodynamic Process:
A thermodynamic process is a procedure
by which the initial state of a system changes
to its final state. During such a change, there
may be a transfer of heat into the system from
its environment, (positive heat), for example
when water boils heat is transferred to water.
Heat may be released from the system to its
environment (negative heat). Similarly, some
work can be done by the system (positive
work), or some work can be done on the system
(negative work). When the piston in a cylinder
is pushed in, some work is done on the system.
We know that these changes should occur
infinitesimally slowly so that the system
is always in thermodynamic equilibrium.
Such processes in which changes in the state
variables of a system occur infinitesimally
slowly are called quasi static systems.
When a thermodynamic system changes
from its initial state to its final state, it passes
through a series of intermediate states. This
series of intermediate states when plotted on a
p - V diagram is called a path. The p - V curve
or the p - V diagram, shown in Fig. 4.11 is such
a path. It tells us the way a system has gone
through a change.
4.7.1 Work Done During a Thermodynamic
Process:

Fig. 4.12 (b): Pressure and volume both change.

Second way to change the state from A
to state B is path 2 as shown in Fig. 4.12 (c).
In this case, the volume increases to Vf from
the point A up to the point C at the constant
pressure pi. The pressure then decrease to pf as
shown. The volume remains constant during
this change. The system is now in the state B
with its coordinates given by (Vf , pf).

Fig. 4.12 (c): First the volume changes at
constant pressure and then pressure changes at
constant volume.

The work done in this process is
represented by the shaded area under the curve
2 as in Fig. 4.12 (c).
Third way to change the state from A to
state B is path 3 as shown in Fig. 4.12 (d). In
this case, the pressure decreases from pi to pf
but the volume remains the same. Next, the
volume changes to Vf at constant pressure pf.
The work done in this process is represented

Fig. 4.12 (a): Different ways to change a system.

Let us understand the relation between a
path and the work done along a path. Consider
Fig. 4.12 (a) which describes different ways
in which we can change the state of a system.
The system is initially at state A on the p-V
diagram. Its pressure is pi and volume is Vi. We
say that the state is indicated by the coordinates
86

There are two different ways in which
this change in volume can be made. Figure
4.13 (a) shows the first method. In this case,
the gas is heated slowly, in a controlled manner
so that it expands at a constant temperature. It
reaches the final volume Vf isothermally. The
system absorbs a finite amount of heat during
this process.

by the shaded area under the curve 3 as in
Fig. 4.12 (d). It is easily noticed that in the
three cases we discussed, the amount of work
done is not the same.

Fig. 4.12 (d): First the pressure drops at constant
volume and then volume increases at constant
pressure.

Remember that these are only three paths
amongst many along which the system can
change its state. It is interesting to note that in
all these cases, though work done during the
change of state is different, the initial and the
final state of the system is the same.
We conclude that the work done by a system
depends not only on the initial and the final
states, but also on the intermediate states, i.e.,on
the paths along which the change takes place.

Fig. 4.13 (b): Sudden uncontrolled expansion
of gas. No heat enters, system does no work
(W=0, Q=0).

In the second case, shown in Fig. 4.13 (b)
gas cylinder is now surrounded by an
insulating material and it is divided into two
compartments by a thin, breakable partition.
The compartment X has a volume Vi and
the compartment Y has a volume V'i so that
Vi + V'i = Vf . The compartment X of the cylinder
is filled with the same amount of gas at the
same temperature as that in the first case
shown in the Fig. 4.13 (a). The compartment
Y is empty, it contains no gas particles or any
other form of matter. The initial state of the
system is the same in both cases.
The partition is now suddenly broken. This
causes a sudden, uncontrolled expansion of the
volume of the gas. The gas occupies the volume
that was empty before the partition is broken.
There is no exchange of heat between the gas
and its environment because the cylinder is
now surrounded by an insulating material. The
final volume of the system after the partition
is broken is Vf . In this case, the gas has not
done any work during its expansion because it
has not pushed any piston or any other surface
for its expansion. Such expansion is called

4.7.2 Heat Added During a Thermodynamic
Process:
Thermodynamic state of a system can
be changed by adding heat also. Consider a
thermodynamic system consisting of an ideal
gas confined to a cylinder with a movable,
frictionless, and massless piston. Suppose
we want to change the initial volume Vi of
the gas to the final volume Vf at a constant
temperature.

Burner supplies heat, system does work on
piston (W>0, Q>0).

free expansion. A common example of free
expansion is abrupt puncturing of an inflated
balloon or a tyre.
It is experimentally observed that when an
ideal gas undergoes a free expansion, there is
no change of temperature. Therefore, the final
state of the gas in this case also, is the same
as the first case. The intermediate states or the
paths during the change of state in the first and
the second case are different. But the initial
and the final states are the same in both cases.
Figures 4.13 (a) and (b) represent two different
ways of taking a system from the initial state
to the final state. This means we have two
different paths connecting the same initial and
the final states of a system.
In case of the method shown in
Fig. 4.13 (a) there is an exchange of heat. In
case of the method shown in Fig. 4.13 (b),
there is no exchange of heat and also, the
system does not do any work at all because
there is no displacement of any piston or any
other surface.
To conclude, heat transferred to a system
also depends on the path.
4.7.3 Classification of Thermodynamic
Processes:
As we have seen earlier, a thermodynamic
state can be described by its pressure p,
volume V, and temperature T. These are the
state variables of a system. At present, we will
restrict our description of a thermodynamic
system only to its pressure, volume and
temperature.
A process by which two or more of
these variables can be changed is called a
thermodynamic process or a thermodynamic
change. As we have discussed earlier, there
can be a number of different ways to change
these parameters, that is, there are different
thermodynamic processes. But in practice, for
the sake of measurement, any one of the state
variables is held constant and other two are
varied. This leads us to a very useful way of
classifying thermodynamic processes.

1. Reversible and Irreversible Processes:
We know that when two objects at
different temperatures are brought in thermal
contact they reach a thermal equilibrium. In this
process, the object at higher temperature loses
its heat and the object at lower temperature
gains heat. (But we never observe that after
some time, the two objects are back to their
initial temperatures). The object that was
previously hot never becomes hot again and
the previously cold object never becomes cold
again once they reach thermal equilibrium.
That means the two objects at different
temperatures reaching thermal equilibrium
is an irreversible process. Such processes
do not restore the initial state of the system.
Puncturing an inflated balloon or a tyre,
rubbing our palms together, burning a candle
are some familiar examples of irreversible
thermodynamic processes.
Some processes such as melting of
ice, freezing of water, boiling of water,
condensation of steam can be reversed.
That means the initial sates of the system
can be restored. These are some familiar
thermodynamic processes that are reversible.
A thermodynamic process (change) can
be a reversible process (change) or it can be an
irreversible process (change).

Fig. 4.14 (a): p-V diagram of Reversible process.

Earlier, we have seen that a thermodynamic
process can be represented by a p - V diagram.
A reversible process is a change that can be
retraced in reverse (opposite) direction. The
path of a reversible thermodynamic process
is the same in the forward and the reverse
direction. Figure 4.14 (a) shows the path of
88

a reversible thermodynamic process. This
path shows a reversible expansion of a gas
followed by its reversible compression. Such
changes are very slow and there is no loss of
any energy in the process and the system is
back to its initial state after it is taken along
the reverse path. Reversible processes are
ideal processes. A real thermodynamic process
will always encounter some loss due to friction
or some other dissipative forces.

1. Many processes such as a free expansion
or an explosive chemical reaction take the
system to non-equilibrium states.
2. Most processes involve friction, viscosity
or some other dissipative forces. For
example, an object sliding on a surface
stops after moving through some distance
due to friction and loses its mechanical
energy in the form of heat to the surface
and it gets heated itself. The dissipative
forces are always present everywhere and
can be minimized at best, but cannot be
fully eliminated.
Remember this
All spontaneous natural processes are
irreversible. For example, heat always
flows from a higher temperature to a lower
temperature on its own. We can say that an
irreversible process gives us the preferred
direction of a thermodynamic process.
An irreversible process can be said to be
unidirectional process.

Fig. 4.13 (b): p-V diagram of Irreversible process.

An irreversible process is a change that
cannot be retraced in reverse (opposite)
direction. The path of an irreversible
thermodynamic process is not the same in
the forward and the reverse direction. Figure
4.14 (b) shows the path of an irreversible
thermodynamic process. There is a permanent
loss of energy from the system due to friction
or other dissipative forces in an irreversible
process. The change of state depends on
the path taken to change the state during
an irreversible process. An irreversible
process shows a hysteresis. Most real life
thermodynamic processes that we deal with
are irreversible.

Assumptions
for
discussion
of
thermodynamic processes:
We will be discussing various types of
thermodynamic systems in the following
sections. Here are the assumptions we make
for this discussion.
i) Majority of the thermodynamic processes
we will be discussing in the following
sections are reversible. That is, they
are quasistatic in nature. They are
extremely slow and the system undergoes
infinitesimal change at every stage except
the adiabatic processes. The system is,
therefore, in thermodynamic equilibrium
during all the change.
ii) The ‘system’ involved in all the processes
is an ideal gas enclosed in a cylinder having
a movable, frictionless, and massless
piston. Depending on the requirements
of the process, the walls of the cylinder

can be good thermal conductors (for an
isothermal process) or can be thermally
insulating (for an adiabatic process).
iii) The ideal gas equation is applicable to the
system.
2. Isothermal process:
A process in which change in pressure and
volume takes place at a constant temperature
is called an isothermal process or isothermal
change. For such a system ∆T = 0. Isothermal
process is a constant temperature process. This
is possible when a system is in good thermal
contact with its environment, and the transfer
of heat from, or to the system, is extremely
slow so that thermal equilibrium is maintained
throughout the change.
For example, melting of ice, which takes
place at constant temperature, is an isothermal
process.

For an ideal gas, its internal energy
depends on its temperature. Therefore, during
an isothermal process, the internal energy of an
ideal gas remains constant (∆U = 0) because
its temperature is constant (∆T = 0).
The first law of thermodynamics (Eq. 4.4)
when applied to an isothermal process would
now read as,
Q=W

Thus, the heat transferred to the gas is
completely converted into the work done, i.e.,
for expansion of the gas. From Eq. (4.8) it is
obvious that when the gas absorbs heat, it does
positive work and its volume expands. When
the gas is compressed, it releases heat and it
does negative work.
Any change of phase occurs at a constant
temperature, and therefore, it is an isothermal
process. Figure 4.15 shows the p - V diagram
of an isothermal process. It is called as an
isotherm.

Remember this
1. For an isothermal process, none of the
quantities Q and W is zero.
2. For an isothermal change, total amount
of heat of the system does not remain
constant.
Thermodynamics of Isothermal Process:
The temperature of a system remains
constant in an isothermal change and Boyle’s
law can be applied to study these changes.
Therefore, the equation of state for an
isothermal change is given by,
pV = constant
--- (4.6)
If pi , Vi and pf Vf are the variables of
a system in its initial and the final states
respectively, then for an isothermal change,
pi, Vi = pf Vf = constant.
Consider the isothermal expansion of
an ideal gas. Let its initial volume be Vi and
the final volume be Vf . The work done in an
infinitesimally small isothermal expansion is
given by Eq. (4.1), dW = pdV. The total work

3. Isobaric process:
It is a constant pressure process. Boiling
water at constant pressure, normally at
atmospheric pressure, is an isobaric process.
Figure (4.16) shows the p-V diagram of an
isobaric process. It is called as an isobar. The
different curves shown on the maps provided
by the meteorology department are isobars.
They indicate the locations having same
pressure in a region. For an isobaric process,
none of the quantities ∆U, Q and W is zero.

Example 4.5:
0.5 mole of gas at temp 300 K expands
isothermally from an initial volume of 2.0L
to final volume of 6.0L. (a) What is the work
done by the gas ? (R = 8.31 J mol-1 K-1),

Can you explain the significance of
positive sign of the work done and the heat?

Fig. 4.16 : p - V diagram of an isobaric process.

Thermodynamics of Isobaric process:
The pressure of a system remains constant
in this process i.e. ∆p = 0. Consider an ideal
gas undergoing volume expansion at constant
pressure. If Vi and Ti are its volume and
temperature in the initial state of a system and
Vf and Tf are its final volume and temperature
respectively, the work done in the expansion is
given by

Remember this
Always remember for an isothermal
process:
1. Equation of state: pV = constant
2. ∆T = 0. Constant temperature process,
perfect thermal equilibrium with
environment.
3. ∆U = 0. No change in internal
energy, energy is exchanged with the
environment.
4. Q = W. Energy exchanged is used to do
work.
5. W = p ∆V
6. An isothermal change is a very slow
change. The system exchanges heat
with its environment and is in thermal
equilibrium with it throughout the change.

Also, the change in the internal energy of
a system is given by,
--- (4.11)
U  nCV T  nCV T f  Ti





Where, CV is the specific heat at constant
volume and ∆T = (Tf - Ti) is the change in its
temperature during the isobaric process.
According to the first law of
thermodynamics, the heat exchanged is given
by,
Q = ∆U + W
Using the previous two equations we get,

Equation (4.12) tells that the temperature
of a system changes in an isobaric process
therefore, its internal energy also changes
(Eq. 4.11). The heat exchanged (Eq. 4.12)
is partly used for increasing the temperature
and partly to do some work. The change in
the temperature of the system depends on the
specific heat at constant pressure Cp.

p-V diagram of an isochoric process. For an
isochoric process, ∆V =0, and we have, from
the first law of thermodynamics, ∆U = Q.
This means that for an isochoric change, all
the energy added in the form of heat remains
in the system itself and causes an increase
in its internal energy. Heating a gas in a
constant volume container or diffusion of a
gas in a closed chamber are some examples of
isochoric process.

Example 4.6:
One mole of an ideal gas is initially kept in
a cylinder with a movable frictionless and
massless piston at pressure of 1.0mPa, and
temperature 27°C. It is then expanded till its
volume is doubled. How much work is done
if the expansion is isobaric?
Solution: Work done in isobaric process
given by W = p∆V = (Vf - Vi).
Vf = 2Vi ∴ W = 2pVi.
Vi can be found by using the ideal gas
equation for initial state.

Thermodynamics of Isochoric process:
For an isochoric process, we have, ∆V =0.
The system does not do any work and all the
energy supplied to the system is converted
into its internal energy. The first law of
thermodynamics for isochoric process is
Q = ∆U 			--- (4.13)
The change in internal energy is given by

Remember this
Always remember for an isobaric process:
1. ∆p = 0. Constant pressure process.
2. Temperature of the system changes,
∆T ≠ 0.
3. Q = ∆U + W. Energy exchanged is
used to do work and also to change
internal energy, i.e., to increase its
temperature.
4. W = p∆V. Volume changes when work
is done.

Remember this
Always remember for an isochoric
process:
1. ∆V = 0. Constant volume process.
2. W = 0. No work is done because volume
remains constant, ∆V = 0.
3. Q = ∆U. Energy exchanged is used to
change internal energy.
4. ∆T ≠ 0. Temperature of the system
changes.

4. Isochoric process:
It is a constant volume process. A system
does no work on its environment during an
isochoric change. Figure 4.17 shows the

5. Adiabatic process:
It is a process during which there is no
transfer of heat from or to the system. Figure
4.18 shows the p-V diagram of an adiabatic
process. For an adiabatic change, Q = 0. Heat
transfer to or from the system is prevented
by either perfectly insulating the system
from its environment, or by carrying out the
change rapidly so that there is no time for
any exchange of heat. Puncturing an inflated
balloon or a tyre are some familiar examples
of adiabatic changes. For an adiabatic change,
∆U = - W 			
--- (4.15)
When a system expands adiabatically, W is
positive (work is done by the system) and ∆U
is negative, the internal energy of the system
decreases. When a system is compressed
adiabatically, W is negative (work is done on
the system), and ∆U is positive. The internal
energy of the system increases in an adiabatic
process. It is observed that for many systems,
temperature increases when internal energy
increases and decreases when the internal
energy is decreased.

for polyatomic gases.

Equations (3.23), (3.24) and (3.25) can be
extended to obtain these values.
An adiabatic system is thermally isolated
from its environment, therefore, it cannot
exchange heat with it. Therefore, when a
system undergoes an adiabatic change, its
temperature and internal energy both change.
The change in internal energy is,
∆U = Cv (∆T) 			--- (4.17)

Thermodynamics of Adiabatic process:
For an adiabatic process we have,
pV γ = constant = C
--- (4.16)
where, γ is the ratio of the specific heat at
constant pressure to the specific heat at
Cp
constant volume, i.e., γ =

Equation (4.20) implies that when work is done
by the gas, i.e., when the gas expands, W > 0,
and Ti > Tf. This mean that the gas will cool
down. Similarly, if the work is done on the gas,
i.e., if the gas is compressed W < 0, and Ti < Tf.
This means that the gas will warm up.

Always remember for an adiabatic process:

1. Equation of state: pV = constant.
2. Q = 0. No exchange of heat with the
surroundings. The system is perfectly
insulated from its environment, or the
change is very rapid.
3. ∆U = - W. All the work is utilized
to change the internal energy of the
system.
4. ∆T ≠ 0. Temperature of the system
changes.

heating up of the system.

The pressure involved in this process
is about 45 atm. This is an adiabatic

is increased without any transfer of heat.
Similar heating is used in automobile

is heated rapidly to such a high temperature
that it ignites without any spark plug.

The work done during adiabatic process is
very much less than the work done during
isothermal process. Can you explain
this? What happens to this work which is
apparently 'lost' ?

7. Most of the times, an adiabatic change
is a sudden change. During a sudden
change, the system does not find
any time to exchange heat with its
environment.
Example 4.7: An ideal gas of volume
1.0L is adiabatically compressed to
(1/15)th of its initial volume. Its initial
pressure and temperature is 1.01 ×105 Pa

Work done in the process from B to A
along path 1 is given by the area under this
curve. In this process volume is decreasing
therefore the work done is negative.
The total work done during the
complete cycle, from A to B along path 2
and form B to A along path 1 is the area
enclosed by the closed loop. This is the
difference between the area under the curve
1 and that under the curve 2. Since the area
under curve 1 is negative and larger than
the area under the curve 2, the area of the
loop is also negative. That means the work
is done by the system is negative.
(b) This is a cyclic process which means
the initial and the final state of the
system is the same. For a cyclic process
∆U = 0, so Q = W = - 1000 J. That is,
1000 joules of heat must be rejected by the
system.
(c) If the direction of the cycle is changed
the work done will be positive. The system
will do work. Form this example we
conclude that: The total work done in a
cyclic process is positive if the process
is goes around the cycle in a clockwise
direction. The total work done in a cyclic
process is negative if the process goes
around the cycle in a counterclockwise
direction.

Can you tell?
When the temperature of a system is
increased or decreased in an adiabatic
heating or cooling, is there any transfer of
heat to the system or from the system?
6. Cyclic Process:
A thermodynamic process that returns a
system to its initial state is a cyclic process.
In this process, the initial and the final state is
the same. Figure 4.19 shows the p-V diagram
of a cyclic process. For a cyclic process, the
total change in the internal energy of a system
is zero. (∆U = 0). According to the first law
of thermodynamics, we have, for a cyclic
process,
Q = W

Remember this
Working of all heat engines is a cyclic
process.

Can you tell?
1. How would you interpret the Eq. 4.21
for a cyclic process?

Example 4.8: Cyclic process:
The total work done in the cyclic process
shown in the Fig. 4.19 is -1000 J. (a) What
does the negative sign mean? (b) What is
the change in internal energy and the heat
transferred during this process. (c) What
will happen when the direction of the cycle
is changed?
Solution: (a) Work done in the process from
A to B along path 2 is given by the area
under this curve. In this process, volume
is increasing therefore the work done is
positive.

2. An engine works at 5000 RPM, and it
performs 1000 J of work in one cycle.
If the engine runs for 10 min, how much
total work is done by the engine?
7. Free Expansion:
These
expansions
are
adiabatic
expansions and there is no exchange of heat
between a system and its environment. Also,
there is no work done on the system or by the
system. Q = W = 0, and according to the first
law of thermodynamics, ∆U = 0. For example,
when a balloon is ruptured suddenly, or a tyre
95

is suddenly punctured, the air inside rushes out
rapidly but there is no displacement of a piston
or any other surface. Free expansion is different
than other thermodynamic processes we have
discussed so far because it is an uncontrolled
change. It is an instantaneous change and the
system is not in thermodynamic equilibrium.
A free expansion cannot be plotted on a p-V
diagram. Only its initial and the final state can
be plotted.

A heat engine receives heat from a source
called reservoir and converts some of it into
work. Remember that all the heat absorbed
is not converted into work by a heat engine.
Some heat is lost in the form of exhaust.
A typical heat engine has the following
elements:
(1) A working substance: It is called the
system. It can be an ideal gas for an ideal heat
engine (to be discussed later). For a practical
heat engine, the working substance can be a
mixture of fuel vapour and air in a gasoline
(petrol) or diesel engine, or steam in a steam
engine. It is the working substance that absorbs
heat and does work.
(2) Hot and cold reservoir: The working
substance interacts with the reservoirs. The
hot reservoir is the source of heat. It is at a
relatively high temperature and is capable of
providing large amount of heat at constant
higher temperature, TH. It is also called as
the source. The cold reservoir absorbs large
amount of heat from the working substance
at constant lower temperature, TC. It is also
called as the sink.
(3) Cylinder: Generally, the working
substance is enclosed in a cylinder with a
moving, frictionless, and massless piston.
The working substance does some work by
displacing the piston in the cylinder. This
displacement is transferred to the environment
using some arrangement such as a crank shaft
which transfers mechanical energy to the
wheels of a vehicle.
Heat engines are of two basic types. They
differ in the way the working substance absorbs
heat. In an external combustion engine, the
working substance is heated externally as in
case of a steam engine. In case of the internal
combustion engine, the working substance
is heated internally similar to an automobile
engine using gasoline or diesel.
Any heat engine works in following three basic
steps.

Example 4.9: A cyclic process ABCA
is shown in V-T
V
diagram (Fig (a)).
It is performed with
a constant mass of
V
ideal gas. How will
this transform to a
T
T
(Fig (a)
p-V digram?
Solution: Straight line form A to B on the
V-T diagram means
V ∝ T, i.e., 'p' is
constant. V is constant
p
and
temperature
decreases.
Along
B - C i.e., p should
V
also decrease.
(Fig (b)
Temperature is constant along CA. That
means it is an isothermal process. The p-V
curve would look as shown in the Fig (b).
4.8 Heat Engines:
As mentioned earlier, thermodynamics
is related to study of different processes
involving conversion of heat and work into
each other. In this section, we will study the
practical machines that convert some heat into
work. These are heat engines.
4.8.1 Heat Engine:
Heat engines are devices that transform
heat partly into work or mechanical energy.
Heat engines work by using cyclic processes
and
involve
thermodynamic
changes.
Automobile engines are familiar examples of
heat engines.
96

the pipeline indicated by W is proportional to
the part of the heat converted into mechanical
work.
One single execution of the steps
mentioned above is one operating ‘cycle’ of
the engine. Several such cycles are repeated
when a heat engine operates. The quantities QH
and QC represent the amount of heat absorbed
(positive) and rejected (negative) respectivety
during one cycle of operation.

1. The working substance absorbs heat from
a hot reservoir at higher temperature.
2. Part of the heat absorbed by the working
substance is converted into work.
3. The remaining heat is transferred to a cold
reservoir at lower temperature.
Heat engines are classified according to
the working substance used and the way these
steps are actually implemented during its
operation. Heat engines are diagrammatically
represented by an energy flow diagram
schematically shown in Fig. 4.20. Energy
exchange takes place during various stages of
working of a heat engine.

Do you know?
The number of repetitions of the operating
cycles of an automobile engine is indicated
by its RPM or Revolutions Per Minute.
The net heat Q absorbed per operating
cycle is,
Q  QH  QC  QH  Qc
--- (4.22)
The net work done in one operating cycle,
by the working substance, is given by using the
first law of thermodynamics.
W  Q   QH  Qc
--- (4.23)
Ideally, we would expect a heat engine
to convert all the heat absorbed, QH , in to
work. Practically, this is not possible. There is
always some heat lost, i.e., QC ≠ 0 . The thermal
efficiency η of the heat engine is defined as,
W
		
--- (4.24)

QH
Thus, the thermal efficiency, or simply,
the efficiency of a heat engine is the ratio of
the work done by the working substance and the
amount of heat absorbed by it. It is the ratio of
the output, in the form of the work done W by
the engine, and the input, in the form of the heat
supplied QH. In simple words, efficiency of a
heat engine is the fraction of the heat absorbed
that is converted into work, Eq. (4.24).
In terms of the energy flow diagram
Fig. 4.20, the ‘pipeline’ representing the
work is as wide as possible and the pipeline
representing the exhaust is as narrow as
possible for the most efficient heat engine.

Fig. 4.20: Schematic energy flow diagram of a
heat engine.

Let QH be the heat absorbed by the
working substance at the source, and QC be
the heat rejected by it at the sink. In a heat
engine, QH is positive and QC is negative.
Also, let W be the work done by the working
substance.
In the Fig. 4.20, the circle represents the
engine. The ‘heat pipelines’ shown in the
diagram represent the heat absorbed, rejected,
and converted into work. The width of the heat
‘pipeline’ indicated by QH, is proportional to the
amount of heat absorbed at the source. Width
of the branch indicated by QC is proportional
to the magnitude | QC | of the amount of heat
rejected at the sink. Width of the branch of
97

The operating cycle begins at the point A
in the cycle. The working substance, the gas in
this case, absorbs heat at constant volume and
no work is done by the gas or on the gas. The
pressure is increased till the point B is reached.
The temperature of the gas also increases and
its internal energy increases.
The gas starts expanding by pushing the
piston away and its volume changes from
the point B to the point C. Because the gas
expands, its pressure is reduced. The gas does
work in this part of the cycle.
When the point C is reached, the excess
heat, the heat that is not utilized in doing work
by the gas, is rejected. The gas cools down and
its internal energy decreases. This process is
again at constant volume. The pressure of the
gas is reduced and point D on the p-V diagram
is reached.
The gas is now compressed. Its volume
decreases and its pressure increases. The
change continues till the point A is reached.
The cycle is complete and the system is ready
for the next cycle.
Thus, the p-V diagram is a visual tool
for the study of heat engines. The working
substance of a heat engine is usually a gaseous
mixture. Study of the p-V diagram helps us
understand the behavior of the three state
variables of a gas throughout the operational
cycle.
The operation of a heat engine is a cyclic
process therefore, its p-V diagram is a closed
loop. The area of the loop represents the work
done during one complete cycle.
Since work is done by the gas, or on
the gas, only when its volume changes, the
p-V diagram provides a visual interpretation
of the work done during one complete cycle.
Similarly, the internal energy of the gas
depends upon its temperature. Hence, the
p-V diagram along with the temperatures
calculated from the ideal gas law determines
the changes in the internal energy of the gas.

There is a fundamental limit on the efficiency
of a heat engine set by the second law of
thermodynamics, which we will discuss later.
Using Eq. (4.22) and Eq. (4.23) we can
write the efficiency of a heat engine as,

quantities which represent energy. Therefore,
it has no units but, we must express W, QH, and
QC in the same units.
4.8.2 The Heat Engine Cycle and the p-V
Diagram:
As discussed previously, the working
of a heat engine is a well defined sequence
of operations. It is a cyclic thermodynamic
process. We know that a thermodynamic
process can be represented by a p-V diagram.
We will now discuss the p-V diagram of a
heat engine. Keep in mind that this is a p-V
diagram of a general heat engine. There are
different ways of operating a heat engine. We
will discuss some such heat engines in the
following sections.
A heat engine uses energy absorbed in the
form of heat to do work and then rejects the
heat which cannot be used to do work. Heat is
absorbed in one part of the cycle, work is done
in another part, and the unused heat is rejected
in yet other part of the cycle. The p-V diagram
of a typical heat engine is shown in Fig. (4.21).

Fig. 4.21: p-V diagram of a typical heat engine.

Figure 4.22 shows the concept of
transferring heat from a cold region to a hot
region in a schematic way. Heat from the
cold region is carried to the hot region by
the refrigerant. It extracts heat from a cold
region due to forced evaporation. The heat of
evaporation of the refrigerant thus absorbed is
rejected by compressing and condensing it into
liquid at a higher temperature. All this process
is carried out in a mechanism involving a
compressor and closed tubing such as seen at
the back of a house hold refrigerator.

We can calculate the amount of heat added or
rejected from the first law of thermodynamics.
Thus, a p-V diagram helps us analyze the
performance of any heat engine which uses a
gas as its working substance.
4.9 Refrigerators and Heat Pumps:
So far, we have discussed a heat engine
which takes heat from a source at higher
temperature and rejects it to a sink at lower
temperature. The input provided to the working
substance (a gas or a mixture of gasoline and
air) in a heat engine is in the form of heat
which is converted into mechanical work as
output. Figure 4.20 shows this in the form of an
energy flow diagram. Refrigerators and heat
pumps are heat engines that work in backward
direction. They convert mechanical work into
heat.
4.9.1 Heat Flow from a Colder Region to a
Hotter Region:
According to the second law of
thermodynamics (to be discussed in the next
article), heat cannot flow from a region of
lower temperature to a region of higher
temperature on its own. We can force heat to
flow from a region of lower temperature to a
region of higher temperature by doing work on
the system (or, on the working substance of a
heat engine). Refrigerators or air-conditioners
and heat pumps are examples of heat engines
which cause heat to be transferred from a
cold region to a hot region. Usually, this is
achieved with the aid of phase change of a
fluid, called the refrigerant. The refrigerant
is forced to evaporate and then condense by
successively decreasing and increasing its
pressure. It can, therefore, ‘pump’ energy
from a region at lower temperature to a region
of higher temperature. It extracts the heat of
vaporization of the refrigerant from the cold
region and rejects it to the hotter region outside
the refrigerator. This results in cooling down
the cold region further.

Fig. 4.22: Schematic diagram of transferring
heat from a cold region to a hot region.

4.9.2 Refrigerator:
Refrigeration is a process of cooling
a space or substance of a system and/or to
maintain its temperature below its ambient
temperature. In simple words, refrigeration is
artificial cooling.

Fig. 4.23 (a): Schematics of a refrigerator.

A refrigerator extracts heat from
a cold region (inside the chamber, or
the compartments) and delivers it to the
surrounding (the atmosphere) thus, further
cooling the cold region. That’s the reason
why if you place your hand behind a working
99

refrigerator, you can feel the warm air. But
the interior of the refrigerator is cold. An air
conditioner also works on similar principles.
Figure 4.23 (a) shows the schematics of
the mechanism used in a typical refrigerator.
It consists of a compressor, an expansion
valve, and a closed tube which carries the
refrigerant. Part of the tube, called the cooling
coil, is in the region which is to be cooed at
lower temperature and lower pressure. The
other part which is exposed to the surrounding
(generally, the atmosphere) is at a higher
temperature and higher pressure. A fluid
such as (fluorinated hydrocarbons) is used as
refrigerant. Normally, the cold and the hot part
of the coil contain the refrigerant as a mixture
of liquid and vapour phase in equilibrium.

up as heat is transferred to it from the contents
of the fridge. This takes place at constant
pressure, so it's an isobaric expansion.
Step 3: The gas is transferred to a compressor,
which does most of the work in this process.
The gas is compressed adiabatically, heating
it and turning it back to a liquid.
Step 4: The hot liquid passes through coils on
the outside of the fridge, and heat is transferred
to the atmosphere. This is an isobaric
compression process.
The compressor is driven by an external
energy source and it does the work |W| on the
working substance during each cycle.
4.9.3 Performance of a Refrigerator:
Consider the energy flow diagram of
a refrigerator Fig. 4.23 (b). It shows the
relation between the work and heat involved
in transferring heat from a low temperature
region to a high temperature region. This is a
cyclic process in which the working substance,
the refrigerant in this case, is taken back to the
initial state.
For a refrigerator, the heat absorbed
by the working substance is QC and the heat
rejected by it is QH. A refrigerator absorbs
heat at lower temperature and rejects it at
higher temperature, therefore, we have,
QC > 0, QH < 0, and W < 0. Hence, we write,
|W| and |QH| = - QH. In this case, we apply
the first law of thermodynamics to the cyclic
process. For a cyclic process, the internal
energy of the system in the initial state and
the final state is the same, therefore, from
Eq. (4.21), we have,
QH  QC  W , or QH  QC W  0

Fig. 4.23 (b): Energy flow diagram of a
refrigerator.

Figure 4.23 (b) shows the energy flow
diagram of a refrigerator. As you can see,
the heat extracted from a cold reservoir is
supplemented by the mechanical work done
(on the refrigerant) by the compressor and the
total energy is rejected at the hot reservoir. The
refrigerant goes through the following steps in
one complete cycle of refrigeration.
Step 1: The fluid passes through a nozzle and
expands into a low-pressure area. Similar to
the way carbon dioxide comes out of a fire
extinguisher and cools down, the fluid turns
into a gas and cools down. This is essentially
an adiabatic expansion.
Step 2: The cool gas is in thermal contact with
the inner compartment of the fridge. It heats

From the Fig.4.23 (b), we realize that the
heat |QH| rejected by the working substance at
the hot reservoir is always greater than the heat

that the Eq. (4.26), derived for a refrigerator
100

and the Eq. (4.23), derived for a heat engine,
are the same. They are valid for a heat engine
and also for a refrigerator.

The ratio c indicates the performance

of a refrigerator and is called the coefficient

or Q-value of a refrigerator. Larger is the
ratio, better is the refrigerator. That means a
refrigerator has the best performance when
the heat extracted by the refrigerant at the
cold reservoir is maximum by doing minimum
work in one operating cycle.

All the quantities on the right side of
Eq. (4.27) represent energy and are measured
in the same energy units. The coefficient of
performance, K of a refrigerator is, therefore, a
dimensionless number. For a typical household
refrigerator, K ≈ 5.

Do you know?
Capacity of an air conditioner is expressed
in tonne. Do you know why?
Before refrigerator and AC was
invented, cooling was done by using
blocks of ice. When cooling machines were
invented, their capacity was expressed
in terms of the equivalent amount of ice
melted in a day (24 hours). The same term
is used even today.

Remember this
Refrigerator transfers heat from inside a
closed space to its external environment so
that inside space is cooled to temperature
below the ambient temperature.

4.9.5 Heat Pump:
Heat pump is a device which works
similar to a refrigerator. It is used to heat a
building or a similar larger structure by cooling
the air outside it. A heat pump works like a
refrigerator operating inside out. In this case,
the evaporator coils are outside and absorb
heat from the cold air from outside. The
condenser coils are inside the building. They
release the absorbed heat to the air inside the
thus, warming the building.

Do you know?
Capacity of a refrigerator is expressed in
litre. It is the volume available inside a
refrigerator.
4.9.4 Air conditioner:
Working of an air conditioner and a
refrigerator is exactly similar. It differs from a
refrigerator only in the volume of the chamber/
room it cools down. For an air conditioner, the
evaporator coils are inside the room that is to be
cooled and the condenser is outside the room.
The air cooled by the evaporator coils inside
the room is circulated by a fan placed inside
the air conditioning unit. The performance of

Remember this
Heat flow from a hot object to a cold object
is spontaneous whereas, work is always
required for the transfer of heat from a
colder object to a hotter object.

4.10 Second Law of Thermodynamics:
4.10.1 Limitations of the First Law of
Thermodynamics:
The First law of thermodynamics tells us
that heat can be converted into work and work
can also be converted into heat. It is merely
a quantitative statement of the equivalence of
heat and work. It has the following limitations.
(a) It does not tell us whether any particular
process can actually occur. According to the
first law of thermodynamics, heat may, on its
own, flow from an object at higher temperature
to one at lower temperature and it can also,
on its own, flow from an object at lower
temperature to one at higher temperature. We
know that practically, heat cannot flow from
an object at lower temperature to another
at higher temperature. The First law of
thermodynamics does not predict this practical
observation.
(b) According to the First law, we could
convert all (100%) of the heat available to
us into work. Similarly, all the work could
be converted into heat. Again, we know that
practically this is not possible.
Thus, the First law of thermodynamics
does not prevent us from converting heat
entirely into work or work entirely into heat.
These limitations lead to the formulation of
another law of thermodynamics called the
Second law of thermodynamics. We will
discuss this at a later stage in this chapter.
We have seen earlier in section 4.7.3 that
an irreversible process defines the preferred
direction of an irreversible process. It is also
found that it is impossible to build a heat
engine that has 100% efficiency Eq. (4.25).
That is, it is not possible to build a heat engine
that can completely convert heat into work.
Similarly, for a refrigerator it is impossible
to remove heat without doing any work on a
system. That is, the coefficient of performance,
Eq. (4.28) of a refrigerator can never be infinite.

These practical observations form the basis of
a very important principle of thermodynamics,
the Second law of thermodynamics.
The Second law of thermodynamics is
a general principle which puts constraints
upon the direction of heat transfer and the
efficiencies that a heat engine can achieve.

Limitations on efficiency
of a heat engine.

Consider an object A at certain height
of h above the ground and another object B
of the same mass a height of h/2 as shown in
Fig. 4.24 (a). We know that potential energy
of the object B is half that of the object A. That
means we can extract only half the energy
from the object B. Similarly, if a heat engine
as shown in Fig. 4.24 (b) operates between
the temperatures of 800 K and 400 K, i.e., if it
receives heat at 800 K and rejects it at 400 K,
its maximum efficiency can be 50%.
4.10.2 The second law of thermodynamics,
statement:
We now know that heat can be converted
into work by using a heat engine. However,
our practical experience says that entire
heat supplied to the working substance can
never be converted into mechanical work.
Second law of thermodynamics helps us to
understand this. According to the second law
of thermodynamics, “It is impossible to extract
an amount of heat QH from a hot reservoir
and use it all to do work W. Some amount of
102

This means that energy will not
flow spontaneously from an object at
low temperature to an object at a higher
temperature. This rules out the possibility
of a perfect refrigerator. The statements
about refrigerators are also applicable to air
conditioners and heat pumps, which work on
the same principles.
This is the ‘Second form’ or
Clausius statement of the Second law of
thermodynamics. Sometimes it is also
called as the ‘Refrigerator Law’ or the
‘Refrigerator Statement’ of the Second law of
thermodynamics.

heat QC must be exhausted to a cold reservoir.
This prohibits the possibility of a perfect heat
engine”.
Sometimes it is also called as the ‘Engine
Law’ or the ‘Engine Statement’ of the Second
law of thermodynamics.

statement.

Figure 4.25 is a diagrammatic
representation of the application of the Second
law of thermodynamics to a heat engine. As you
can see from the diagram, Fig. 4.25 (a), all heat
engines lose some heat to the environment of a
perfect heat engine. All the heat QH, extracted
can not be used to do work. Figure 4.25 (b)
shows the energy flow diagram for such a
situation.
This form of statement of the Second law
of thermodynamics is called as the KelvinPlanck statement or the ‘First form’ of the
Second law of thermodynamics.
We have seen how the efficiency of a
heat engine is restricted by the second law
of thermodynamics. Heat engine is one form
of ‘heat – work conversion’. Let us see what
happens in case of a refrigerator, the other
form of ‘work – heat conversion’.
“It is not possible for heat to flow from
a colder body to a warmer body without any
work having been done to accomplish this
flow”.

Fig. 4.26 (b): Energy flow of
prefect refrigerator.

Figure 4.26 is a diagrammatic
representation of the application of the Second
law of thermodynamics to a refrigerator. As
you can see form the energy flow diagram,
Fig. 4.26 (a), a practical refrigerator requires
work W to be done to extract heat QH from a
cold reservoir and reject it to a hot reservoir.
The statement means that spontaneous flow of
heat from an object at cold temperature is not
possible Fig. 4.26 (b).

proposed a hypothetical ideal engine in 1824
which has the maximum efficiency.
In a carnot engine, there are basically two
processes:
(i) Exchange of heat (steps A to B and C to D
in the Fig. 4.21). For this to be reversible,
the heat exchange must be isothermal.
This is possible if the working substance
is at the temperature TH of the source while
absorbing heat. The working substance
should be at the temperature of the cold
reservoir TC, while rejecting the heat.
(ii) Work done (steps B to C and D to A). For
work done to be reversible, the process
should be adiabatic.
Thus, the cycle includes two isothermal
and two adiabatic processes for maximum
efficiency. The corresponding p-V diagram
will then be as shown in the Fig. 4.27.

Remember this
When we say that energy will not flow
spontaneously from a cold object to a hot
object, we are referring to the net transfer
of energy. Energy can transfer from a cold
object to a hot object either by transfer
of energetic particles or electromagnetic
radiation. However, in any spontaneous
process, the net transfer of energy will be
from the hot object to the cold object. Work
is required to transfer net energy from a
cold object to a hot object.
4.11 Carnot Cycle and Carnot Engine:
In section 4.7.3, we have discussed the
concept of a reversible and an irreversible
process at length. Now we will discuss why
reversibility is such a basic and important
concept in thermodynamics.
4.11.1 Significance of Reversibility in
Thermodynamics:
We know that a reversible process is a
‘bidirectional’ process, i.e., it follows exactly
the same steps in either direction. This requires
the process to take place in infinitesimally
small steps. Also, the difference between the
state variables in the two infinitesimally close
states should be very small. This would be
possible if the system is in thermodynamic
equilibrium with its environment throughout
the change.
An irreversible process, on the contrary,
is a unidirectional process. It can take place
in only in one direction. Any irreversible
process is not in thermal equilibrium with its
environment.
4.11.2 Maximum Efficiency of a Heat Engine
and Carnot’s Cycle:
We know that conversion of work to heat
(refrigerator, section 4.9.2) is an irreversible
process. A heat engine would convert
maximum heat into work if all irreversible
processes could be avoided. In that case, the
efficiency of the heat engine can be maximum.

depends on only the temperature difference
of the hot and the cold reservoir. When the
temperature difference is very small, the
coefficient is very large. In this case, a large
quantity of heat can be removed from the
lower temperature to the higher temperature
by doing very small amount of work. The
coefficient of performance is very small when
the temperature difference is large. That means
a small quantity of heat will be removed even
when a large amount of work is done.

Use your brain power
Suggest a practical way to increase the
efficiency of a heat engine.
Remember this
Always Remember for a Carnot Engine:
1. Carnot engine is a hypothetical concept.
2. Every process must be either isothermal
or adiabatic.
3. The
system
must
maintain
thermodynamic equilibrium throughout
the cycle so that it is reversible.
4. The efficiency of a Carnot engine can
never be 100% unless TC = 0. We know
that this is not possible practically.
That means even an ideal heat engine,
the Carnot engine, cannot have 100%
efficiency.

Example 4.10: Carnot engine:
A Carnot engine receives 2.0 kJ of heat from
a reservoir at 500 K, does some work, and
rejects some heat to a reservoir at 350 K.

heat is rejected. (c) what is its efficiency?

4.11.2 Carnot Refrigerator:

a heat engine operated in the reverse direction.
Because each step in the Carnot cycle is
reversible, the entire Carnot cycle is reversible.
If we operate the Carnot engine in the reverse
direction, we get the Carnot refrigerator. Using
the Eq. (4.28), we can write the coefficient of

and the Carnot Cycle:
"The Carnot engine is the most efficient
heat engine. Also, all Carnot engines operating
between the same two temperatures have the
same efficiency, irrespective of the nature of
the working substance".
We have made two very important statements
here.
1. Carnot engine is the most efficient heat
engine, and
105

2. Efficiency of a Carnot engine is independent
of its working substance.
We can also show that “A Carnot
refrigerator has a greater coefficient of
performance among all the refrigerators
working between the same two temperatures.”

part of the cycle is released by the gas to
the refrigerator. This heat (Q) is used in the

• Isothermal compression (CD): The heat

is rejected to the coolant (sink). The
temperature of the gas is maintained at TC

this process. Its temperature is increased to

This is a closed thermodynamic cycle. The
Sterling engine is based on this cycle shown
in Fig. 4.28. The working substance used in
a Sterling engine is air, helium, hydrogen,
nitrogen etc. All the processes in the Sterling
cycle are reversible processes. When the gas
is heated, the Sterling engine produces useful
work. When work is done on the gas, it works
as a refrigerator. This is reverse working of
a Sterling cycle. The reversed Sterling cycle
is extensively used in the field of cryogenics
to produce extremely low temperatures or to
liquefy air or gases mentioned above.
The ideal Sterling cycle has two
isothermal processes AB and CD. Two
isobaric processes BC and DA connect the
two isothermal processes. Heat is absorbed
at constant temperature TH and rejected at

5. Oscillations
a definite interval of time is called periodic
motion. A body performing periodic motion
goes on repeating the same set of movements.
The time taken for one such set of movements
is called its period or periodic time. At the end
of each set of movements, the state of the body
is the same as that at the beginning. Some
examples of periodic motion are the motion
of the moon around the earth and the motion
of other planets around the sun, the motion of
electrons around the nucleus, etc. As seen in
Chapter 1, the uniform circular motion of any
object is thus a periodic motion.
Another type of periodic motion in
which a particle repeatedly moves to and
fro along the same path is the oscillatory or
vibratory motion. Every oscillatory motion is
periodic but every periodic motion need not be
oscillatory. Circular motion is periodic but it is
not oscillatory.
The simplest form of oscillatory periodic
motion is the simple harmonic motion in which
every particle of the oscillating body moves
to and fro, about its mean position, along a
certain fixed path. If the path is a straight line,
the motion is called linear simple harmonic
motion and if the path is an arc of a circle,
it is called angular simple harmonic motion.
The smallest interval of time after which the to
and fro motion is repeated is called its period
(T) and the number of oscillations completed
per unit time is called the frequency (n) of the
periodic motion.

Can you recall?
1. What do you mean by linear motion
and angular motion?
2. Can you give some practical examples
of oscillations in our daily life?
3. What do you know about restoring
force?
4. All musical instruments make use of
oscillations, can you identify, where?
5. Why does a ball floating on water
bobs up and down, if pushed down and
released?
5.1 Introduction:
Oscillation is a very common and
interesting phenomenon in the world of Physics.
In our daily life we come across various
examples of oscillatory motion, like rocking
of a cradle, swinging of a swing, motion of the
pendulum of a clock, the vibrations of a guitar
or violin string, up and down motion of the
needle of a sewing machine, the motion of the
prongs of a vibrating tuning fork, oscillations
of a spring, etc. In these cases, the motion
repeated after a certain interval of time is a
periodic motion. Here the motion of an object
is mostly to and fro or up and down.
Oscillatory motion is a periodic motion. In
this chapter, we shall see that the displacement,
velocity and acceleration for this motion can be
represented by sine and cosine functions. These
functions are known as harmonic functions.
Therefore, an oscillatory motion obeying such
functions is called harmonic motion. After
studying this chapter, you will be able to
understand the use of appropriate terminology
to describe oscillations, simple harmonic
motion (S.H.M.), graphical representations
of S.H.M., energy changes during S.H.M.,
damping of oscillations, resonance, etc.
5.2 Explanation of Periodic Motion:
Any motion which repeats itself after

5.3 Linear Simple Harmonic Motion
(S.H.M.):
Place a rectangular block on a smooth
frictionless horizontal surface. Attach one end

f   kx
--- (5.1)
where, k is a constant that depends upon the
elastic properties of the spring. It is called the
force constant. The negative sign indicates
that the force and displacement are oppositely
directed.
If the block is displaced towards left from
its equilibrium position, the force exerted by
the spring on the block is directed towards the
right and its magnitude is proportional to the
displacement from the mean position. (Fig.
5.1(c))
Thus, f = - kx can be used as the equation
of motion of the block.
Now if the block is released from the
rightmost position, the restoring force exerted
by the spring accelerates it towards its
equilibrium position. The acceleration (a) of
the block is given by,
f
k
--- (5.2)
a     x
m
m
where, m is mass of the block. This shows
that the acceleration is also proportional to
the displacement and its direction is opposite
to that of the displacement, i.e., the force and
acceleration are both directed towards the
mean or equilibrium position.
As the block moves towards the mean
position, its speed starts increasing due to
its acceleration, but its displacement from
the mean position goes on decreasing. When
the block returns to its mean position, the
displacement and hence force and acceleration
are zero. The speed of the block at the mean
position becomes maximum and hence its
kinetic energy attains its maximum value.
Thus, the block does not stop at the mean
position, but continues to move beyond the
mean position towards the left. During this
process, the spring is compressed and it exerts
a restoring force on the block towards right.
Once again, the force and displacement are
oppositely directed. This opposing force
retards the motion of the block, so that the

of a spring to a rigid wall and the other end to
the block as shown in Fig. 5.1. Pull the block
of mass m towards the right and release it. The
block will begin its to and fro motion on either
side of its equilibrium position. This motion is
linear simple harmonic motion.

Fig. 5.1 (a), (b) and (c): Spring mass oscillator.

Remember this
For such a motion, as a convention, we shall
always measure the displacement from the
mean position. Also, as the entire motion
is along a single straight line, we need not
use vector notation (only ± signs will be
enough).
Fig. 5.1(b) shows the equilibrium position
in which the spring exerts no force on the
block. If the block is displaced towards the
right from its equilibrium position, the force
exerted by the spring on the block is directed
towards the left [Fig. 5.1(a)]. On account of its
elastic properties, the spring tends to regain its
original shape and size and therefore it exerts a
restoring force on the block. This is responsible
to bring it back to the original position. This
force is proportional to the displacement but its
direction is opposite to that of the displacement.
If x is the displacement, the restoring force f is
given by,

speed goes on reducing and finally it becomes
zero. This position is shown in Fig. 5.1(c). In
this position the displacement from the mean
position and restoring force are maximum.
This force now accelerates the block towards
the right, towards the equilibrium position. The
process goes on repeating that causes the block
to oscillate on either side of its equilibrium
(mean) position. Such oscillatory motion along
a straight path is called linear simple harmonic
motion (S.H.M.). Linear S.H.M. is defined as
the linear periodic motion of a body, in which
force (or acceleration) is always directed
towards the mean position and its magnitude
is proportional to the displacement from the
mean position.

Activity
Some experiments described below can be
performed in the classroom to demonstrate
S.H.M. Try to write their equations.
(a) A hydrometer is
immersed in a glass jar
filled with water. In the
equilibrium
position
it floats vertically in
water. If it is slightly
depressed and released, it bobs up and down
performing linear S.H.M.
(b) A U-tube is filled with a sufficiently long
column of mercury. Initially when both the

arms of U tube are exposed
to atmosphere, the level of
mercury in both the arms

Remember this
A complete oscillation is when the object
goes from one extreme to other and back to
the initial position.
The conditions required for simple harmonic
motion are:
1. Oscillation of the particle is about a
fixed point.
2. The net force or acceleration is always
directed towards the fixed point.
3. The particle comes back to the fixed
point due to restoring force.
Harmonic oscillation is that oscillation
which can be expressed in terms of a single
harmonic function, such as x  a sin t or
x  a cos t
Non-harmonic oscillation is that oscillation
which cannot be expressed in terms of single
harmonic function. It may be a combination
of two or more harmonic oscillations such
as x = a sin ω t + b sin2 ω t , etc.

is the same. Now, if the level of mercury
in one of the arms is depressed slightly
and released, the level of mercury in each
arm starts moving up and down about the
equilibrium position, performing linear
S.H.M.
5.4 Differential Equation of S.H.M. :
In a linear S.H.M., the force is directed
towards the mean position and its magnitude
is directly proportional to the displacement
of the body from mean position. As seen in
Eq. (5.1),
f = - kx
where k is force constant and x is displacement
from the mean position.
According to Newton’s second law of motion,

5.7 Reference Circle Method:
Figure 5.3 shows a rod rotating along a
vertical circle in the x-y plane. If the rod is
illuminated parallel to x-axis from either side
by a linear source parallel to the rod, as shown
in the Fig. 5.3, the shadow (projection) of the
rod will be produced on the y-axis. The tip of
this shadow can be seen to be oscillating about
the origin, along the y-axis.

Fig. A

Fig 5.3: Projection of a rotating rod.

We shall now prove that motion of
the tip of the projection is an S.H.M. if the
corresponding motion of the tip of the rod
is a U.C.M. For this, we should take the
projections of displacement, velocity, etc. on
any reference diameter and confirm that we
get the corresponding quantities for a linear
S.H.M.
Figure 5.4 shows the anticlockwise
uniform circular motion of a particle P, with
centre at the origin O. Its angular positions are
decided with the reference OX. It means, if the
particle is at E, the angular position is zero, at

Fig. B

Parallel combination (Figure B): In such a
combination, all the springs are connected
between same two points, one of them is the
support and at the other end, the stretching
force f is applied at a suitable point.
Irrespective of their spring constants, each
spring will now have the same extension e.
The springs now share the force such that in
the equilibrium position, the total restoring
force is equal and opposite to the stretching
force f.

F it is 90° = π2 , at G it is 180° = πc, and so on. If
it comes to E again, it will be 360° = 2πc (and

not zero). Let r = OP be the position vector of
this particle.

Projection of velocity: Instantaneous velocity
of the particle P in the circular motion is the
tangential velocity of magnitude rω as shown
in the Fig. 5.5.
Its projection on the reference diameter
will be v y  r cos   r cos  t    . This
is the expression for the velocity of a particle
performing a linear S.H.M.
Projection of acceleration: Instantaneous
acceleration of the particle P in circular
motion is the radial or centripetal acceleration
of magnitude rω 2 , directed towards O. Its
projection on the reference diameter will be
a y  r 2 sin   r 2 sin  t  
    2 y .
Again, this is the corresponding
acceleration for the linear S.H.M.
From this analogy it is clear that projection
of any quantity for a uniform circular motion
gives us the corresponding quantity of linear
S.H.M. This analogy can be verified for any
diameter as the reference diameter. Thus, the
projection of a U.C.M. on any diameter is an
S.H.M.
5.8 Phase in S.H.M.:
Phase in S.H.M. (or for any motion) is
basically the state of oscillation. In order to
know the state of oscillation in S.H.M., we
need to know the displacement (position), the
direction of velocity and the oscillation number
(during which oscillation) at that instant of
time. Knowing only the displacement is not
enough, because at a given position there are
two possible directions of velocity (except
the extreme positions), and it repeats for
successive oscillations. Knowing only velocity
is not enough because there are two different
positions for the same velocity (except the
mean position). Even after this, both these
repeat for the successive oscillations.
Hence, to know the phase, we need a
quantity that is continuously changing with
time. It is clear that all the quantities of linear
S.H.M. (x, v, a etc) are the projections taken

Fig 5.4: S.H.M. as projection of a U.C.M.

At t = 0, let the particle be at P0 with
reference angle φ . During time t, it has
angular displacement ω t . Thus, the reference
angle at time t is    t    . Let us choose
the diameter FH along y-axis as the reference
diameter and label OM as the projection of

r = OP on this.
Projection of displacement: At time t, we
get the projection or the position vector
OM = OP sin   y  r sin  t    . This is the
equation of linear S.H.M. of amplitude r. The
term ω can thus be understood as the angular
velocity of the reference circular motion. For
linear S.H.M. we may call it the angular
frequency as it decides the periodicity of the
S.H.M. In the next section, you will come to
know that the phase angle    t    of the
circular motion can be used to be the phase of
the corresponding S.H.M.

on a diameter, of the respective quantities for
the reference circular motion. The angular
displacement    t    can thus be used as
the phase of S.H.M. as it varies continuously
with time. In this case, it will be called as the
phase angle.

5.10 Composition of two S.H.M.s having
same period and along the same path:
Consider
a
particle
subjected
simultaneously to two S.H.M.s having the
same period and along same path (let it be
along the x-axis), but of different amplitudes
and initial phases. The resultant displacement
at any instant is equal to the vector sum of its
displacements due to both the S.H.M.s at that
instant.
Equations of displacement of the two S.H.M.s
along same straight line (x-axis) are
x1 = A1 sin (ωt + φ1 ) and x2 = A2 sin (ωt + φ2 )
The resultant displacement (x) at any instant
(t) is given by x = x1 + x2
x = A1 sin (ωt + φ1 ) + A2 sin (ωt + φ2 )
∴ x = A1 sin ωt cos φ1 + A1cos ωt sin φ1
+ A2 sin ωt cos φ2 + A2 cos ωt sin φ2
A1, A2, φ1 and φ2 are constants and ωt is variable.
Thus, collecting the constants together,
x = (A1 cos φ1 + A2 cos φ2 ) sin ωt +
(A1 sin φ1 + A2 sin φ2 ) cos ωt
As A1, A2, φ1 and φ2 are constants, we can
combine them in terms of another convenient
constants R and δ as

R cos δ = A1 cos φ1 + A2 cos φ2 --- (5.17)
and R sin δ = A1 sin φ1 + A2 sin φ2 --- (5.18)
∴ x = R (sin ωt cos δ + cos ωt sin δ)
∴ x = R sin (ωt + δ)
This is the equation of an S.H.M. of the
same angular frequency (hence, the same
period) but of amplitude R and initial phase δ.
It shows that the combination (superposition)
of two linear S.H.M.s of the same period and
occurring a long the same path is also an
S.H.M.

Activity
Tie a string horizontally tight between
two vertical supports. To this string, tie
three pendula, two of them (A and B) of
equal lengths. Third one (C) need not have
the same length, but not very different.
Oscillate the pendula A and B in a plane
perpendicular to the horizontal string. It
will be observed that pendulum C also
starts oscillating in the same plane, with the
same period as those of A and B.
With this system and procedure, we are
imposing two S.H.M.s of the same period.
The resultant energy transfers through
the strings into the third pendulum C and
it starts oscillating. Special cases (i), (ii)
and (iii) above can be verified by making
suitable changes.

5.11: Energy of a Particle Performing
S.H.M.:
While performing an S.H.M., the particle
possesses speed (hence kinetic energy) at all
the positions except at the extreme positions.
In spite of the presence of a restoring force
(except at the mean position), the particle
occupies various positions. This is an
indication that work is done and the system
has potential energy (elastic - in the case of
a spring, gravitational - for a pendulum,
magnetic - for a magnet, etc.). Total energy of
the particle performing an S.H.M. is thus the
sum of its kinetic and potential energies.
Consider a particle of mass m, performing
a linear S.H.M. along the path MN about the
mean position O. At a given instant, let the
particle be at P, at a distance x from O.

T' be the tension in the string. The pendulum
remains in equilibrium in the position OA,
with the centre of gravity of the bob, vertically
below the point of suspension O. If now the
pendulum is displaced through a small angle
θ (called angular amplitude) and released, it
begins to oscillate on either side of the mean

In the displaced position (extreme

along the string, towards the support and
(ii) Weight mg, in the vertically downward
direction.
At the extreme positions, there should not be
any net force along the string. The component
of mg can only balance the force due to
tension. Thus, weight mg is resolved into two
components;
(i) The component mg cos θ along the string,
which is balanced by the tension T ' and
(ii) The component mg sin θ perpendicular
to the string is the restoring force acting on
mass m tending to return it to the equilibrium
position.

5.12 Simple Pendulum:
An ideal simple pendulum is a heavy
particle suspended by a massless, inextensible,
flexible string from a rigid support.
A practical simple pendulum is a small
heavy (dense) sphere (called bob) suspended
by a light and inextensible string from a rigid
support.
122

(b) The period of a simple pendulum is
inversely proportional to the square root
of acceleration due to gravity.
(c) The period of a simple pendulum does not
depend on its mass.
(d) The period of a simple pendulum does
not depend on its amplitude (for small
amplitude).
These conclusions are also called the 'laws of
simple pendulum'.

Using this relation, we can find the length

the acceleration due to gravity at that place.
Experimentally, if Ls is known, it can be used
to determine acceleration due to gravity g at
that place.

while deriving the expression the following
assumptions are made.
(i) The amplitude of oscillations is very

length).
(ii) The length of the string is large and
(iii) During the oscillations, the bob moves

Example 5.11: In summer season, a
pendulum clock is regulated as a second’s
pendulum and it keeps correct time. During
winter, the length of the pendulum decreases
by 1%. How much will the clock gain or
lose in one day. (g = 9.8 m/s2)

the clock keeps correct time. Thus, in a day
of 86400 seconds, the clock’s pendulum

When you perform the experiment to
determine the period of simple pendulum, it
is recommended to keep the amplitude very
small. But how small should it be? And why?
To find this it would be better to

With this period, the pendulum will now

perform
= 43417 oscillations per

day. Thus, it will gain 43417 - 43200 = 217
oscillations, per day.
Per oscillations the clock refers to 2 second.
Thus, the time gained, per day = 217 × 2
= 434 second = 7 minutes, 14 second.

It shows that the error in the time
period is about 2% at amplitude of 20°, 5%
at amplitude of 50°, 10% at amplitude of
70° and 18% at amplitude of 90°. Thus, the
recommended maximum angular amplitude
is less than 20°. It also helps us in restricting
the oscillations in a single vertical plane.

5.13: Angular S.H.M. and its Differential
Equation:
Figure 5.11 shows a metallic disc attached
centrally to a thin wire (preferably nylon or
metallic wire) hanging from a rigid support. If
the disc is slightly twisted about the axis along
the wire, and released, it performs rotational
motion partly in clockwise and anticlockwise
(or opposite) sense. Such oscillations are called
angular oscillations or torsional oscillations.
This motion is governed by the restoring
torque in the wire, which is always opposite
to the angular displacement. If its magnitude
happens to be proportional to the corresponding
angular displacement, we can call the motion
to be angular S.H.M.

Angular S.H.M. is defined as the oscillatory
motion of a body in which the torque for
angular acceleration is directly proportional
to the angular displacement and its direction is
opposite to that of angular displacement.

5.13.1 Magnet Vibrating in Uniform
Magnetic Field:
If a bar magnet is freely suspended in the
plane of a uniform magnetic field, it remains
in equilibrium with its axis parallel to the
direction of the field. If it is given a small
angular displacement θ (about an axis passing
through its centre, perpendicular to itself and
to the field) and released, it performs angular
oscillations Fig. (5.12).

The solution is found to be of the form

If the amplitude of oscillations of an
oscillator is reduced by the application of an
external force, the oscillator and its motion
are said to be damped. Periodic oscillations
of gradually decreasing amplitude are
called damped harmonic oscillations and
the oscillator is called a damped harmonic
oscillator.
For example, the motion of a simple
pendulum, dies eventually as air exerts a
viscous force on the pendulum and there may
be some friction at the support.
Figure 5.13 shows a block of mass m that
can oscillate vertically on a spring. From the
block, a rod extends to vane that is submerged
on a liquid. As the vane moves up and down,
the liquid exerts drag force on it, and thus on the
complete oscillating system. The mechanical
energy of the block-spring system decreases
with time, as energy is transferred to thermal
energy of the liquid and vane.
The damping force (Fd) depends on the
nature of the surrounding medium and is
directly proportional to the speed v of the vane
and the block

5.15 Free Oscillations, Forced Oscillations
and Resonance:
Free Oscillations: If an object is allowed
to oscillate or vibrate on its own, it does so
with its natural frequency (or with one of its
natural frequencies). For example, if the bob
of a simple pendulum of length l is displaced
and released, it will oscillate only with the
1 g
frequency n 
which is called its
2 l
natural frequency and the oscillations are
free oscillations. However, by applying a
periodic force, the same pendulum can be
made to oscillate with different frequency. The
oscillations then will be forced oscillations
and the frequency is driver frequency or forced
frequency.

absorbs maximum energy from the source. In
such case, it is said to be in resonance with
the source (pendulum A). For unequal natural
frequencies on either side (higher or lower), the
energy absorbed (hence, the amplitude) is less.
If the activity is repeated for a set of pendula
of different lengths and squares of their
amplitudes are plotted against their natural
frequencies, the plot will be similar to that
shown in the Fig. 5.16. The peak occurs when
the forced frequency matches with the natural
frequency, i.e., at the resonant frequency.

Consider the arrangement shown in
the Fig. 5.15. There are four pendula tied to
a string. Pendula A and C are of the same
length, pendulum B is shorter and pendulum
D is longer. Pendulum A is having a solid
rubber ball as its bob and will act as the driver
pendulum or source pendulum. Other three
pendula are having hollow rubber balls as their
bobs and will act as the driven pendula. As the
pendula A and C are of the same lengths, their
natural frequencies are the same. Pendulum
B has higher natural frequency as it is shorter
and pendulum D is of lower natural frequency
than that of A and C.

Fig 5.16: Resonant frequency.

In Chapter superposition of waves, you
will see that most of the traditional musical
instruments use the principle of resonance. In
the topic AC circuits, the resonance in the L.C.
circuits is discussed.

Fig 5.15: Forced oscillations.

Pendulum A is now set into oscillations in
a plane perpendicular to the string. In the course
of time it will be observed that the other three
pendula also start oscillating in parallel planes.
This happens due to the transfer of vibrational
energy through the string. Oscillations of A are
free oscillations and those of B, C and D are
forced oscillations of the same frequency as
that of A. The natural frequency of pendulum
C is the same as that of A, as it of the same
length as that of A.
It can also be seen that among the pendula
B, C and D, the pendulum C oscillates with
maximum amplitude and the other two with
smaller amplitudes. As the energy depends
upon the amplitude, it is clear that Pendulum C
has absorbed maximum energy from the source
pendulum A, while the other two absorbed
less. It shows that the object C having the
same natural frequency as that of the source

6. Superposition of Waves
The water is displaced locally where the stone
actually falls in water. The disturbance slowly
spreads and distant particles get disturbed from
their position of rest. The wave disturbs the
particles for a short duration during its path.
These particles oscillate about their position
of rest for a short time. They are not bodily
moved from their respective positions. This
disturbance caused by the stone is actually a
wave pulse. It is a disturbance caused locally
for a short duration.
A wave, in which the disturbance
produced in the medium travels in a given
direction continuously, without any damping
and obstruction, from one particle to another,
is a progressive wave or a travelling wave
e.g., the sound wave, which is a pressure wave
consisting of compressions and rarefactions
travelling along the direction of propagation
of the wave.
6.2.1 Properties of progressive waves:
1) Each particle in a medium executes the
same type of vibration. Particles vibrate
about their mean positions performing
simple harmonic motion.
2) All vibrating particles of the medium
have the same amplitude, period and
frequency.
3) The phase, (i.e., state of vibration of a
particle), changes from one particle to
another.
4) No particle remains permanently at rest.
Each particle comes to rest momentarily
while at the extreme positions of vibration.
5) The particles attain maximum velocity
when they pass through their mean
positions.
6) During the propagation of wave, energy
is transferred along the wave. There is no
transfer of matter.
7) The wave propagates through the medium

Can you recall?

2. What is a wave pulse?

waves?
4. What happens when a wave
propagates?
5. What are mechanical waves?
6. What are electromagnetic waves?
7. How are mechanical waves different
from electromagnetic waves?
8. What are sound waves?
6.1 Introduction:
You may be familiar with different waves
like water waves, sound waves, light waves,
mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves
etc. A mechanical wave is a disturbance
produced in an elastic medium due to periodic
vibrations of particles of the medium about
their respective mean positions. In this
process, energy and momentum are transferred
from one particle to another. Thus, a wave
carries or transfers energy from one point to
another., but there is no transfer of matter or
particles of the medium in which the wave
is travelling. Another type of waves, known
as electromagnetic waves, do not require
material medium for their propagation; these
are non-mechanical waves. We have studied
sound waves (which are mechanical waves),
their properties and various phenomena like
echo, reverberation, Doppler effect related to
these waves in earlier classes. In this Chapter,
we will study mechanical waves, reflection
of these waves, principle of superposition of
waves, various phenomena like formation of
stationary waves, beats, and their applications.
6.2 Progressive Wave:
Have you seen ripples created on the
surface of water when a stone is dropped in it?
131

are rad m-1, m and rad s-1 respectively. If
T is the time period of oscillation, then
n = 1/T = ω /(2π) is the frequency of oscillation
measured in Hz (s-1). If the wave is travelling
to the left i.e., along the negative x-direction,
then the equation for the disturbance is

with a certain velocity. This velocity
depends upon properties of the medium.
8) Progressive waves are of two types transverse waves and longitudinal waves.
9) In a transverse wave, vibrations of
particles are perpenduclar to the direction
of propogation of wave and produce crests
and troughs in their medium of travel.
In longitudinal wave, vibrations of
particles produce compressions and
rarefactions along the direction of
propagation of the wave.
10) Both, the transverse as well as the
longitudinal, mechanical waves can
propagate through solids but only
longitudinal waves can propagate through
fluids.
You might recall that when a mechanical
wave passes through an elastic medium, the
displacement of any particle of the medium
at a space point x at time t is given by the
expression
y  x , t   f  x  vt  		
--- (6.1)
where v is the speed at which the disturbance
travels through the medium to the right
(increasing x). The factor  x  vt  appears
because the disturbance produced at the point x
= 0 at time t reaches the point x = x′ on the right
at time (t + x′/v) or we say that the disturbance
of the particle at time t at position x = x′
actually originated on the left side at time (t
- x′/v). Thus Eq. (6.1) represents a progressive
wave travelling in the positive x-direction with
a constant speed v. The function f depends on
the motion of the source of disturbance. If the
source of disturbance is performing simple
harmonic motion, the wave is represented as a
sine or cosine function of (x - vt) multiplied by
a term which will make (x - vt) dimensionless.
Generally we represent such a wave by the
following equation
y  x , t   Asin  kx   t

where A is the amplitude of the wave, k = 2π/λ
is the wave number, λ and ω are the wavelength
and the angular frequency of the wave and
v = ω /k is the speed. The SI units of k, λ and ω

Can you tell?
What is the minimum distance between any
two particles of a medium which always
have the same speed if a sine wave travels
through the medium?
6.3 Reflection of Waves:
When a progressive wave, travelling
through a medium, reaches an interface
separating two media, a certain part of the
wave energy comes back in the same medium.
The wave changes its direction of travel. This is
called reflection of a wave from the interface.
Reflection is the phenomenon in which
the sound wave traveling from one medium
to another comes back in the original medium
with slightly different intensity and energy. To
understand the reflection of waves, we will
consider three examples below.
6.3.1 Reflection of a Transverse Wave:

Fig. 6.1: Reflection of a wave pulse sent as a
crest from a rarer medium to a denser medium.

Example 1
• Take a long light string AB. Attach one
end of the string to a rigid support at B.
(Here, for the wave pulse traveling on the
string, the string is the rarer medium and
the rigid support acts as a denser medium.)
• By giving a jerk to the free end A of the
string, a crest is generated in the string.
• Observe what happens when this crest
moves towards B?
• Observe what happens when the crest
reaches B?
132

•

Perform the same activity repeatedly and
observe carefully. Try to find the reasons
of movements in above observations.
Example 2 					

•

Observe the part of wave pulse reflected
back on the heavy string.
• Produce a wave pulse as a crest on the
light string Q moving towards the junction
point O.
• Observe the part of wave pulse reflected
on the light string.
• What difference do you observe when the
wave pulse gets reflected on the light string
and when the wave pulse gets reflected on
the heavy string?
• Try to find reasons behind your
observations.
In example 1, when crest moves along the
string towards B, it pulls the particles of string
in upward direction. Similarly when the crest
reaches B at rigid support, it tries to pull the
point B upwards. But being a rigid support,
B remains at rest and an equal and opposite
reaction is produced on the string according
to Newton’s third law of motion. The string is
pulled downwards. Thus crest gets reflected as
a trough (Fig. 6.1) or a trough gets reflected as a
crest. Hence from example 1, we can conclude
that when transverse wave is reflected from a
rigid support, i.e., from a denser medium, a
crest is reflected as a trough and a trough is
reflected as a crest. You have learnt in Xth and
XIth Std. that there is a phase difference of π
radian between the particles at a crest and at
a trough. Therefore we conclude that there is
a phase change of π radian on reflection from
the fixed end, i.e., from a denser medium.
In example 2, we observe that when the
crest reaches the point B, it pulls the ring
upwards and causes the ring to move upward.
The wave is seen to get reflected back as a
crest and no phase change occurs on reflection
from a rarer medium (Fig. 6.2).
In example 3, we find that a crest
travelling from the heavy string gets reflected
as a crest from the lighter string, i.e., reflection
at the surface when a wave is travelling from
a denser medium to a rarer medium causes a
crest to be reflected as a crest (Fig. 6.3 (a)).

Fig.6.2: Reflection of a wave pulse sent as a
crest from a denser medium to a rarer medium.

•

Take a long light string AB. Attach the
end B of the string to a ring which can
slide easily on a vertical metal rod without
friction. (Here string is the denser medium
while end B attached to the sliding ring is
at the interface of a rarer medium as it can
move freely.)
• Give a jerk to free end A of the string.
• Observe what happens when crest reaches
the point B attached to the ring.
• Try to find the reason of the observed
movement.
Example 3

(a)

(b)
Fig. 6.3: Reflection of a crest from (a) denser
medium (in this case a heavy string) and (b)
rarer medium (in this case a light string).

•

•

Take a heavy string P and a light string
Q and join them. Suppose they are joined
at point O. (Heavy string acts as a denser
medium and light string is the rarer
medium.)
Produce a wave pulse as a crest on the heavy
string P moving towards the junction O.
133

But in example 3 (Fig. 6.3 (b)), when a crest
travels from the lighter string to the heavy
string, the crest is reflected as a trough and
vice versa.
6.3.2 Reflection of a Longitudinal Wave:
Consider a longitudinal wave travelling
from a rarer medium to a denser medium. In
a longitudinal wave compression is a high
pressure region while rarefaction is a low
pressure region. When compression reaches
the denser medium, it tries to push the particles
of that medium. But the energy of particles in
the rarer medium is not sufficient to compress
the particles of denser medium. According to
Newton’s third law of motion, an equal and
opposite reaction comes into play. As a result,
the particles of rarer medium get compressed.
Thus, when the longitudinal wave travels
from a rarer medium to a denser medium, a
compression is reflected as a compression and
a rarefaction is reflected as a rarefaction. There
is no change of phase during this reflection
(Fig. 6.4).

Fig. 6.5: Reflection of a longitudinal wave from
a rarer medium.

6.4 Superposition of Waves:
Suppose you wish to listen to your
favourite music. Is it always possible
particularly when there are many other sounds
from the surroundings disturbing you. How can
the background sounds be blocked? Of course,
the mobile lover generation uses headphones
and enjoys listening to its favorite music.
But you cannot avoid the background sound
completely. Why?
We know that sound waves are
longitudinal waves propagating through an
elastic medium. When two waves travelling
through a medium cross each other, each
wave travels in such a way as if there is no
other wave. Each wave sets the particles of
the medium into simple harmonic motion.
Thus each particle of the medium is set into
two simple harmonic motions due to the two
waves. The total displacement of the particles,
at any instant of time during travelling of
these waves, is the vector sum of the two
displacements. This happens according to the
principle of superposition of waves, which
states that, when two or more waves, travelling

Fig. 6.4: Reflection of a longitudinal wave from
a denser medium.

When longitudinal wave travels from a
denser medium to a rarer medium (Fig. 6.5),
a compression is reflected as a rarefaction.
Here reversal of phase takes place, i.e., phase
changes by π radians.
When compression reaches a rarer
medium from denser medium, it pushes the
particles of rare medium. Due to this, particles
of the rarer medium get compressed and move
forward and a rarefaction is left behind. Thus
a compression gets reflected as a rarefaction.
Similarly a rarefaction gets reflected as a
compression (Fig. 6.5).

through a medium, pass through a common
point, each wave produces its own displacement
at that point, independent of the presence of
the other wave. The resultant displacement
at that point is equal to the vector sum of the
displacements due to the individual wave at that
point. As displacement is a vector, we must add

the individual displacements by considering
their directions. There is no change in the
shape and nature of individual waves due to
superposition of waves. This principle applies
to all types of waves like sound waves, light
134

waves, waves on a string etc. and we say that
interference of waves has taken place.

propagation after superposition are shown
in Figs. 6.6 (a) to 6.6 (f). Suppose two
waves cross each other between t = 2 s and
t = 4 s, as shown in Figs. 6.6 (c), (d) and
(e). Here the two wave pulses superpose,
the resultant displacement is equal to the
sum of the displacements (full line) due to
individual wave pulses (dashed lines). This
is constructive interference. The displacement
due to wave pulses after crossing at t = 5 s and
t = 6 s are shown in Figs. 6.6 (f) and (g). After
crossing each other, both the wave pulses
continue to maintain their individual shapes.
6.4.2 Superposition of Two Wave Pulses
of Equal Amplitude and Opposite Phases
Moving towards Each Other :

You might have seen singers using a special
type of headphones during recording of
songs. Those are active noise cancellation
headphones, which is the best possible
solution to avoid background sound.
Active noise cancellation headphones
consist of small microphones one on each
earpiece. They detect the ambient noise
that arrives at the ears. A special electronic
circuit is built inside the earpiece to create
sound waveforms exactly opposite to the
arriving noise. This is called antisound.
The antisound is added in the earphones so
as to cancel the noise from outside. This is
possible due to superposition of waves, as
the displacements due to these two waves
cancel each other. The phenomena of
interference, beats, formation of stationary
waves etc. are based on the principle of
superposition of waves.
Let us consider superposition of two wave
pulses in two different ways.
6.4.1 Superposition of Two Wave Pulses of
Equal Amplitude and Same Phase Moving
towards Each Other :

Fig. 6.7: Superposition of two wave pulses of
equal amplitude and opposite phases moving
towards each other.

The propagation of approaching wave
pulses, their successive positions after every
second, their superposition and propagation
after superposition are shown in Fig. 6.7 (a) to
Fig. 6.7 (e).
These wave pulses superimpose at
t = 2 s and the resultant displacement (full
line) is zero, due to individual displacements
(dashed lines) differing in phase exactly
by 180°. This is destructive interference.
Displacement due to one wave pulse is
cancelled by the displacement due to the
other wave pulse when they cross each other
(Fig. 6.7 (c)). After crossing each other, both

of equal amplitude and same phase moving
towards each other.

The propagation of approaching wave
pulses, their successive positions after
every second, their superposition and their
135

the wave pulses continue and maintain their
individual shapes.
6.4.3 Amplitude of the Resultant Wave
Produced due to Superposition of Two Waves:
Consider two waves having the same frequency
but different amplitudes A1 and A2. Let these
waves differ in phase by ϕ . The displacement
of each wave at x = 0 is given as
y1  A1 sin  t

phase, the resultant amplitude is
A  A12  2A1 A2 cos  A2 2  (A1  A2 ) 2
= |A1- A2|
The resultant amplitude is minimum when
ϕ = π.
If the amplitudes of the waves are equal i.e.,
A1 = A2 = A (say), then the resultant amplitude
is zero.
Thus, the maximum amplitude is the
sum of the two amplitudes when the phase
difference between the two waves is zero and
the minimum amplitude is the difference of
the two amplitudes when the phase difference
between the two waves is π.
The intensities of the waves are
proportional to the squares of their amplitudes.
Hence, when ϕ = 0

and when = π

Therefore intensity is maximum when the
two waves interfere in phase while intensity is
minimum when the two waves interfere out of
phase.
You will learn more about superposition
of waves in Chapter 7 on Wave Optics.

This is the equation of the resultant

interfering waves. The resultant amplitude A

(6.5).

Special cases:

where x and y are in centimeter and t is in

these two waves at the points x = 5 cm and
t = 2 s.

are the maximum and minimum values of
the intensity?

A  A12  2 A1 A2 cos 0  A2 2  (A1  A2 ) 2

The resultant amplitude is maximum when
ϕ = 0.
If the amplitudes of the waves are equal i.e.,
A1 = A2 = A (say), then the resultant amplitude
is 2A.
2. When ϕ = π, i.e., the waves are out of

136

∴ frequency n = 1/T = (1/16) × 103 s-1
= 62. 5 Hz
As shown in Fig. (b), points A, B, and C
correspond to mean positions, but the string
is moving in one direction at point A and
in the opposite direction at point B. Thus,
out of the two consecutive particles at
their mean positions, one will be moving
upwards while the other will be moving
downwards. The distance between them
is 2.0 cm. Therefore distance between two
consecutive particles moving in the same
direction will be 2 × 2 cm = 4 cm. Thus the
wavelength λ = 4 cm = 0.04 m
Speed of wave v = n × λ = 62.5 × 0.04
= 2.5 m/s.
6.5 Stationary Waves:
We have seen the superposition of two
wave pulses, having same amplitudes and either
same phase or opposite phases, and changes
in the resultant amplitude pictorially in section
6.4. We have also derived the mathematical
expression for the resultant displacement when
two waves of same frequency superimpose as
given by Eqs. (6.4) to (6.6). Now we are going
to study an example of superposition of waves
having the same amplitude and the same
frequency travelling in opposite directions.
6.5.1 Formation of Stationary Waves:
Imagine a string stretched between two
fixed points. If the string is pulled at the
middle and released, we get what is know as a
stationary wave. Releasing of string produces
two progressive waves travelling in opposite
directions. These waves are reflected at the
fixed ends. The waves produced in the string
initially and their reflected waves combine
to produce stationary waves as shown in
Fig. 6.8 (a).

Example 6.2: A progressive wave travels
on a stretched string. A particle on this
string takes 4.0 ms to move from its mean
position to one of its extreme positions. The
distance between two consecutive points on
the string which are at their mean positions
(at a certain time instant) is 2.0 cm. Find
the frequency, wavelength and speed of the
wave.
Solution :
(a)

(b)
A particles takes 4.0 × 10-3 s to travel from
its mean position to extreme position. This
is a quarter of the complete oscillation as
shown in Fig. (a). Hence, the particle will
take 4 × 4.0 × 10-3 s = 16 × 10-3 s to complete
one oscillation.

6.5.2 Equation of Stationary Wave on a
Stretched String:
Consider two simple harmonic progressive
waves of equal amplitudes (a) and wavelength
(λ) propagating on a long uniform string in
opposite directions (remember 2π/λ = k and
2πn = ω).

When these waves interfere, the resultant

point on the string oscillates with the same
frequency ω (same as that of the individual
progressive wave). All the particles of the
string pass through their mean positions
simultaneously twice during each vibration.
The string as a whole is vibrating with
frequency ω with different amplitudes at
different points. The wave is not moving either
to the left or to the right. We therefore call such
a wave a stationary wave or a standing wave.
Particles move so fast that the visual effect is
formation of loops. It is therefore customary
to represent stationary waves as loops. In case
of a string tied at both the ends, loops are seen
when a stationary wave is formed because
each progressive wave on a string is a traverse
wave. When two identical waves travelling
along the same path in opposite directions
interfere with each other, resultant wave is
called stationary wave.

When sin ω t = 1, at that instant of time,
all the particles for which cos kx is positive
have their maximum displacement in positive
direction. At the same instant, all the particles
for which cos kx is negative have their
maximum displacement in negative direction.
When sin ω t = 0, all the particles cross their
mean positions, some of them moving in the
positive direction and some in the negative
direction.
Longitudinal waves e.g. sound waves
travelling in a tube /pipe of finite length
are relected at the ends in the same way as
transverse waves along a string are reflected
at the ends. Interference between these
waves travelling in opposite directions gives
rise to standing waves as shown in Fig. 6.8
(b). We represent longitudinal stationary
wave by a loop but the actual motion of the
particles is along the length of the loop and not
perpendiculat to it.

6.5.3 Properties of Stationary Waves:
1. Stationary waves are produced due to
superposition of two identical waves (either
transverse or longitudinal waves) traveling
139

through a medium along the same path in
opposite directions.
If two identical transverse progressive
waves superimpose or interfere, the
resultant wave is a transverse stationary
wave as shown in Fig. 6.8 (a).
When a transverse stationary wave is
produced on a string, some points on the
string are motionless. The points which do
not move are called nodes.
There are some points on the string which
oscillate with greatest amplitude (say A).
They are called antinodes.
Points between the nodes and antinodes
vibrate with values of amplitudes between
0 and A.
If two identical longitudinal progressive
waves superimpose or interfere, the
resultant wave is a longitudinal stationary
wave. Figure 6.8 (b) shows a stationary
sound wave produced in a pipe closed at
one end.
The points, at which the amplitude of the
particles of the medium is minimum (zero),
are called nodes.
The points, at which the amplitude of the
particles of the medium is maximum (say
A), are called antinodes.
Points between the nodes and antinodes
vibrate with values of amplitudes between
0 and A
The distance between two consecutive
λ
nodes is
and the distance between two
2
consecutive antinodes is λ .
2
Nodes and antinodes are produced
alternately. The distance between a node
and an adjacent antinode is λ .
4
The amplitude of vibration varies
periodically in space. All points vibrate
with the same frequency.
Though all the particles (except those
at the nodes) possess energy, there is
no propagation of energy. The wave is
localized and its velocity is zero. Therefore,
we call it a stationary wave.

8. All the particles between adjacent nodes
(i.e., in one loop) vibrate in phase. There
is no progressive change of phase from
one particle to another particle. All the
particles in the same loop are in the same
phase of oscillation, which reverses for the
adjacent loop.
Musical instruments such as violin, tanpura,
are based on the principle of formation of
stationary waves or standing waves.

6. All particles between two consecutive
nodes are moving in the same direction
and are in phase while those in adjacent
loops are moving in opposite directions
and differ in phase by 180° in stationary
waves but in a progressive wave, phases of
adjacent particles are different.

What happens if a simple pendulum is
pulled aside and released?
What happens when a guitar string is
plucked?
Have you noticed vibrations in a drill
machine or in a washing machine? How
do they differ from vibrations in the
above two cases?
A vibrating tuning fork of certain
frequency is held in contact with table
top and vibrations are noticed and then
another vibrating tuning fork of different
frequency is held on table top. Are the
vibrations produced in the table top the
same for both the tuning forks? Why?

6.6 Free and Forced Vibrations:
The frequency at which an object tends
to vibrate when hit, plucked or somehow
disturbed is known as its natural frequency.
In these vibrations, object is not under the
influence of any outside force.
When a simple pendulum is pulled aside
and released, it performs free vibrations with
its natural frequency. Similarly when a string
of guitar is plucked at some point it performs
free vibrations with its natural frequency.
In free vibration, the body at first is
given an initial displacement and the force is
then withdrawn. The body starts vibrating and
continues the motion on its own. No external
force acts on the body further to keep it in
motion.
Free vibration of a system means that the
system vibrates at its natural frequency. In
case of free vibrations, a body continuously

6.5.4 Comparison of Progressive Waves and
Stationary Waves:

travels form one region to the other with
definite velocity. In stationary waves,
disturbance remains in the region where it
is produced, velocity of the wave is zero.
2. In progressive waves, amplitudes of all
particles are same but in stationary waves,
amplitudes of particles are different.
3. In a stationary wave, all the particles cross
their mean positions simultaneously but in
a progressive wave, this does not happen.
4. In progressive waves, all the particles are
moving while in stationary waves particles
at the position of nodes are always at rest.
5. Energy is transmitted from one region
to another in progressive waves but in
stationary waves there is no transfer of
energy.

conditions that constrain the possible
wavelengths or frequencies of vibration
of the system. These are called the natural
frequencies of normal modes of oscillations.
The minimum of these frequencies is termed the
fundamental frequency or the first harmonic.
The corresponding mode of oscillations is
called the fundmental mode or fundamental
tone. The term overtone is used to represent
higher frequencies. The first frequency higher
than the fundamental frequency is called
the first overtone, the next frequency higher
is the second overtone and so on. The term
'harmonic' is used when the frequency of a
particular overtone is an intergral multiple
of the fundamental frequency. In strings and
air columns, the frequencies of overtoners
are integral multiples of the fundamental
frequencies, hence they are termed as
harmonics. But all harmonics may not be
present in a given sound. The overtones are
only those multiples of fundamental frequency
which are actually present in a given sound.
The harmonics may or may not be present in
the sound so produced.
To understand the concept of harmonics
and overtones, let us study vibrations of air
column.

loses energy due to frictional resistance of
surrounding medium. Therefore, the amplitude
of vibrations goes on decreasing, the vibrations
of the body eventually stop and the body comes
to rest.
The vibrations in a drill machine and in a
washing machine are forced vibrations. Also
the vibrations produced in the table top due to
tuning forks of two different frequencies are
different as they are forced vibrations due to
two tuning forks of different frequencies.
In forced vibrations, an external periodic
force is applied on a body whose natural period
is different from the period of the force. The
body is made to vibrate with a frequency equal
to that of the externally impressed force. The
amplitude of forced vibrations depends upon
the difference between the frequency of external
periodic force and the natural frequency of the
body. If this difference is small, the amplitude
of forced vibrations is large and vice versa. If
the frequencies exactly match, it is termed as
resonance and the amplitude of vibration is
maximum.
An object vibrating with its natural
frequency can cause another nearby object to
vibrate. The second object absorbs the energy
transmitted by the first object and starts
vibrating if the natural frequencies of the two
objects match. You have seen the example of
two simple pendula supported from a string in
the previous chapter. The second object is said
to undergo forced vibrations. Strings or air
columns can also undergo forced oscillations
if the frequency of the external source of sound
is close to the natural frequency of the system.
Resonance is said to occur and we hear a
louder sound.
6.7 Harmonics and Overtones:
When a string or an air column is set
into vibrations by some means, the waves are
reflected from the ends and stationary waves
can be formed. An important condition to form
stationary waves depends on the boundary

6.7.1 End Correction:
When an air column vibrates either in a
pipe closed at one end or open at both ends,
boundary conditions demand that there is
always an antinode at the open end(s) (since
the particles of the medium are comparatively
free) and a node at the closed end (since there is
hardly any freedom for the particles to move).
The antinode is not formed exactly at the open
end but it is slightly beyond the open end as air
is more free to vibrate there in comparison to
the air inside the pipe. Also as air particles in
the plane of open end of the pipe are not free
to move in all directions, reflection takes place
at the plane at small distance outside the pipe.
141

The distance between the open end of the pipe
and the position of antinode is called the end
correction. According to Reynold, to the first
approximation, the end correction at an end is
given by e = 0.3d, where d is the inner diameter
of the pipe. Thus the length L of air column is
different from the length l of the pipe.

generating vibrations
of air column in a
pipe closed at one end.
The distance of the
antinode from the open
end of the pipe has
been exaggerated.

For a pipe closed at one end

This is the simplest mode of vibration of
air column closed at one end, known as the
fundamental mode.

The fundamental frequency is also known
as the first harmonic. It is the lowest frequency
of vibration in air column in a pipe closed at
one end.
The next mode of vibrations of air column
closed at one end is as shown in Fig. 6.9 (b).
Here the air column is made to vibrate in such
a way (as shown in Fig. 6.9 (b)) that it contains
a node at the closed end, an antinode at the
open end with one more node and antinode
in between. If n1 is the frequency and λ1 is the
wavelength of wave in this mode of vibrations
in air column, we have, the length of the air

Consider a long cylindrical tube closed at
one end. It consists of an air column with rigid
boundary at one end. When a vibrating tuning
fork is held near the open end of the closed
pipe, sound waves are sent by the fork inside
the tube. Longitudinal waves traveling along
a pipe of finite length are reflected at the ends
as transverse waves are refelcted at the fixed
ends of a string. The phase of the reflected
wave depends on whether the end of the pipe
is open or closed and how wide or narrow the
pipe is in compansion to the wavelength of
longitudinal wave like a sound wave.

At the closed end there is least freedom
for motion of air particles. Thus, there must be
a node at the closed end. The particles little
beyond the open end are most free to vibrate.
As a result, an antinode must be formed little
beyond the open end. The lenght l of pipe and
length L of air column are shown separately in
all the figures (refer Figs. 6.9 and 6.10).

This frequency is the third harmonic. It is
the first overtone. Remember that the overtones
are always numbered sequentially.

The first mode of vibrations of air column
closed at one end is as shown in Fig. 6.9 (a).
142

Even though both the ends of the pipe are
open, the air inside the pipe is still bound by the
wall of the tube. As a result, the air inside the
pipe is little denser than the air outside. When
the waves travel to the other open end, there is
partial reflection at the open end. The partially
reflected waves superimpose with the incident
waves. Under suitable conditions, stationary
waves will be formed. There is maximum
freedom for motion of air column at both the
ends as pipe is open at both ends.
Suppose a compression produced by a
tuning fork travels through the air column. It

The next higher mode of vibrations of air
column closed at one end is as shown in Fig.
6.10 (c). Here the same air column is made to
vibrate in such a way that it contains a node
at the closed end, an antinode at the open end
with two more nodes and antinodes in between.

overtone we get the frequency np as
-- (6.21)

Thus for a pipe closed at one end only odd
harmonics are present and even harmonics are
absent.
6.7.3 Vibrations of air column in a pipe open
at both ends:
In this case boundary conditions are such
that an antinode is present at each open end.
When a source of sound like a tuning fork
is held near one end of the pipe, it sends the
waves inside the pipe.

gets reflected as a rarefaction at open end. The
rarefaction moves back and gets reflected as
compression at the other end. It suffers second
reflection at open end near the source and then
interferes with the wave coming in by a path
difference of 2L.
The different modes of vibrations of air
column in pipe open at both ends are shown
in Fig. 6.10 (a), (b) and (c). The fundamental
tone or mode of vibrations of air column open
at both ends is as shown in Fig. 6.10 (a). There

It may be noted that
1. Sound produced by an open pipe contains
all harmonics. Its quality is richer than
that produced by a closed pipe.
2. Fundamental frequency of vibration of air
column in an open pipe is double that of
the fundamental frequency of vibration in
a closed pipe of the same length.
Using the formula and knowing values
of n, l and end correction velocity of sound
in air at room temperature can be calculated.
As discussed earlier, the antinodes are formed
little beyond the open ends of the pipe. It is
however not possible to locate the positions
of the antinodes precisely. Therefore, in
experiments, the length of the pipe is measured
and end corrections are incorporated.
6.7.4 Practical Determination of End

correction, using two pipes of same diameter
but different lengths l1 and l2 is as follows.

the tube has been neglected.

Activity

Example 6.4: An air column is of length
17 cm long. Calculate the frequency of 5th
overtone if the air column is (a) closed at
one end and (b) open at both ends. (Velocity
of sound in air = 340 ms-1).
Solution: Given
Length of air column = 17cm = 0.17m
Overtone number p = 5 and velocity of
sound in air = 340 ms-1.
For an air column closed at one end,

Take a glass
tube open at both
ends and clamp
it so that its one
end dips into a
glass
cylinder
containing water
as shown in the
accompanying
figure.
By
changing
the
position of the
tube at the clamp,
you can adjust the length of the air column
in the tube. Hold a vibrating tuning fork of
frequency 488 Hz or 512 Hz just above the
open end of the tube and make the air column
vibrate. What is the difference between the
sounds that you hear? The sound will be
louder. This is an example of resonance.
This set-up is a resonance tube. Note the
heights of the air column when you hear
louder sound. Interpret your observations.
Take another tuning fork of the same
frequency as the first one. Vibrate them
together above the open end of the tube. Do
you hear beats? If the two tuning forks are of
same frequency, you should not hear beats.
In practice, due to usage, frequencies change
and in most of the cases, you will hear beats.
If you do not hear beats, there can be two
reasons : (i) frequencies of the two forks
are exactly same or (ii) the frequencies are
very much different (difference greater than
6-7 Hz) and we cannot recognize the beats.
Then wind a piece of thread around the tong
of one of the tuning fork so that its frequency
changes slightly. Try to hear the beats. By
changing the position of the thread, vary the
frequency and note down your observations
systematically. What information you get

6.7.5 Vibrations Produced in a String:
Consider a string of length l stretched
between two rigid supports. The linear density
(mass per unit length of string) is m and the
tension T acts on the string due to stretching. If
it is made to vibrate by plucking or by using a
vibrator like a tuning fork, a transverse wave
can be produced along the string.
When the wave reaches to the fixed ends
of the string, it gets reflected with change
of phase by π radians. The reflected waves
interfere with the incident wave and stationary
waves are formed along the string. The string
vibrates with different modes of vibrations.
If a string is stretched between two rigid
supports and is plucked at its centre, the string
vibrates as shown in Fig 6.11 (a). It consists
of an antinode formed at the centre and nodes
at the two ends with one loop formed along
its length. If λ is the wavelength and l is the
length of the string, we get

stretched string.

frequency of vibrations or the first harmonic.
If the centre of the string is prevented from
vibrating by touching it with a light object and
string is plucked at a point midway between
one of the segments, the string vibrates as
shown in Fig. 6.11 (b).
Two loops are formed in this mode of
vibrations. There is a node at the centre of the
string and at its both ends. If λ1 is wavelength

in the fundamental harmonic, what is the
wavelength of sound produced in air if the
velocity of sound in air is 330 m/s?
Solution:
The wavelength of the
fundamental mode is λ = 2l, hence the
fundamental frequency is

Thus the frequency of the first overtone
or second harmonic is equal to twice the
fundamental frequency.
The string is made to vibrate in such a way
that three loops are formed along the string as

6.7.6 Laws of a Vibrating String :
The fundamental frequency of a vibrating
string under tension is given as
1 T
,			--- (6.32)
n=
2l m
From this formula, three laws of vibrating
string can be given as follows:
1) Law of length: The fundamental frequency
of vibrations of a string is inversely proportional
to the length of the vibrating string, if tension
and mass per unit length are constant.
n ∝ 1 , if T and m are constant. --- (6.33)
l
2) Law of tension: The fundamental frequency
of vibrations of a string is directly proportional
to the square root of tension, if vibrating length
and mass per unit length are constant.
n ∝ T , if l and m are constant. --- (6.34)
3) Law of linear density: The fundamental
frequency of vibrations of a string is inversely
proportional to the square root of mass per
unit length (linear density), if the tension and
vibrating length of the string are constant.
1
n∝
, if T and l are constant. --- (6.35)
m
If r is the radius and ρ is the density of material
of string, linear density is given as

Thus frequency of second overtone or third
harmonic is equal to thrice the fundamental
frequency. Similarly for higher modes of
vibrations of the string, the frequencies of
vibrations are as 4n, 5n, 6n…etc. Thus all
harmonics are present in case of a stretched
string and the frequencies are given by
np = pn 			--- (6.25)
Example 6.6: A string is fixed at both ends.
What is the ratio of the frequency of the first
harmonic to that of the second harmonic?
Solution: For a string of length l fixed at
both ends, the wavelengths of the first and
second harmonics are given as l = λ/2 and
l = λ1 respectively. Hence the ratio of their
frequencies is

Thus the fundamental frequency of
vibrations of a stretched string is inversely
proportional to (i) the radius of string and (ii)
the square root of the density of the material of
vibrating string.

Fig. 6.12: Experimental set-up of a sonometer.

If the wire is plucked at a point midway
between the bridges, transverse waves are
produced in the wire. Stationary waves are
produced between the two bridges due to
reflection of transverse wave at the bridges
and their superposition. Thus portion AB of
the wire between the two bridges P and Q is
the vibrating length. Wire can also be made to
vibrate by holding a vibrating tuning fork near
it. The frequency of vibration is then same
as that of the tuning fork. If this frequency
happens to be one of the natural frequencies of
the wire, standing waves with large amplitude
are set up in the wire since the two vibrate in
resonance.
To identify the resonance, a small piece of
paper, known as the rider R, is placed over the
wire at a point in the middle of the length AB
as determined by the position of the bridges P
and Q. If the frequency of the tuning fork and
of the fundamental mode of vibration of the
wire match (this is achieved by adjusting the
length AB of wire using the bridges P and Q),
the paper rider happens to be at the antinode
and flies off the wire.
Sonometer can be used to verify the laws
of a vibrating string.
1) Verification of first law of a vibrating
string:
By measuring length of wire and its
mass, the mass per unit length (m) of wire is
determined. Then the wire is stretched on the

fixed at one end. The other end of string is
moved up and down with frequency 15 Hz.

consists of 3 loops. Calculate the speed of
progressive waves which have produced the
stationary wave in the string.

6.8 Sonometer:
A sonometer consists of a hollow
rectangular wooden box called the sound box.
The sound box is used to make a larger mass
of air vibrate so that the sound produced by
the vibrating string (metal wire in this case)
gets amplified. The same principle is applied
in stringed instruments such as the violin,
guitar, tanpura etc. There are two bridges P
and Q along the width of the box which can be
moved parallel to the length of box. A metal
wire of uniform cross-section runs along the
length of the box over the bridges. It is fixed at
one end and its other end passes over a pulley.
A hanger with suitable slotted weights can be
attached to the free end of wire. By changing

the second law of a vibrating string.
3) Verification of third law of a vibrating
string:
For verification of third law of a vibrating
string, two wires having different masses per
unit lengths m1 and m2 (linear densities) are
used. The first wire is subjected to suitable
tension and made to vibrate in unison with
given tuning fork. The vibrating length is noted
as (l1). Using the same fork, the second wire
is made to vibrate under the same tension and
the vibrating length (l2) is determined. Thus the
frequency of vibration of the two wires is kept
same under same applied tension T. It is found
that,
l m = l m2
		 1 1 2
		 l m = constant
1
But by first law of a vibrating string, n ∝
l
1
Therefore we get that, n ∝
, if T and l
m
are constant. This is the third law of vibrating
string.
In this way, laws of a vibrating string are
verified by using a sonometer.

sonometer and the hanger is suspended from
its free end. A suitable tension (T) is applied
to the wire by placing slotted weights on the
hanger. The length of wire (l1) vibrating with
the same frequency (n1) as that of the tuning
fork is determined as follows.
A light paper rider is placed on the wire
midway between the bridges. The tuning fork
is set into vibrations by striking on a rubber
pad. The stem of tuning fork is held in contact
with the sonometer box. By changing distance
between the bridges without disturbing paper
rider, frequency of vibrations of wire is
changed. When the frequency of vibrations of
wire becomes exactly equal to the frequency of
tuning fork, the wire vibrates with maximum
amplitude and the paper rider is thrown off.
In this way a set of tuning forks having
different frequencies n1, n2, n3, …………are
used and corresponding vibrating lengths of
wire are noted as l1, l2, l3……….by keeping
the tension constant (T) . We will observe that
n1l1 = n2l2 = n3l3 =…….= constant, for constant
value of tension (T) and mass per unit length
(m).
∴nl = constant
1
i.e., n ∝ , if T and m are constant.
l
Thus, the first law of a vibrating string is
verified by using a sonometer.
2) Verification of second law of a vibrating
string:
The vibrating length (l) of the given wire
of mass per unit length (m) is kept constant for
verification of second law. By changing the
tension the same length is made to vibrate in
unison with different tuning forks of various
frequencies. If tensions T1, T2, T3……..
correspond to frequencies n1, n2, n3,………etc.
we will observe that.

6.9 Beats:
This is an interesting phenomenon
based on the principle of superposition of
waves. When there is superposition of two
sound waves, having same amplitude but
slightly different frequencies, travelling in the
same direction, the intensity of sound varies
periodically with time. This phenomenon is
known as production of beats.
The occurrences of maximum intensity
are called waxing and those of minimum
intensity are called waning. One waxing and
successive waning together constitute one
beat. The number of beats heard per second is
called beat frequency.
6.9.1 Analytical method to determine beat
frequency:
Consider two sound waves, having same
amplitude and slightly different frequencies n1
and n2. Let as some that they arrive in phase at
some point x of the medium. The displacement
due to each wave at any instant of time at that
point is given as

Example 6.11: A wire has linear density
4.0 × 10-3 kg/m. It is stretched between
two rigid supports with a tension of 360 N.
The wire resonates at a frequency of 420
Hz and 490 Hz in two successive modes.
Find the length of the wire.
Solution: Given m = 4.0 × 10-3 kg/m, T =
360 N. Let the wire vibrate at 420 Hz and
490 Hz in its pth and (p+1)th harmonics.
Then np = np where n is the fundamental

Fig. 6.13: Superposition of two harmonic waves
of nearly equal frequencies resulting in the
formation of beats.

By comparing the instances of successive
waxing and waning, we come to know that
waxing and waning occur alternately with
equal frequency.
The variation in the loudness of sound
that goes up and down is the phenomenon
of formation of beats. It can be considered
as superposition of waves and formation of
standing waves in time at one point in space
where waves of slightly different frequencies
are passing. The two waves are in and out

interference. The interval between two
maximum sound intensities is the time period
of beats.

			 If either a source of sound or a listener
(or both) is moving with respect to air, the
listener detects a sound whose frequency
is different from the frequency of the
sound source. This is Doppler effect.
A microwave signal (pulse) of known
frequency is sent towards the moving airplane.
Principle of Doppler effect giving the apparent
frequency when the source and observer are
in relative motion applies twice, once for
the signal sent by the microwave source and
received by the airplane and second time
when the signal is reflected by the airplane
and is received back at the microwave
source. Phenomenon of beats, arising due to
the difference in frequencies produced by
the source and received at the source after
reflection from the air plane, allows us to
calculate the velocity of the air plane.
The same principle is used by traffic
police to determine the speed of a vehicle to
check whether speed limit is exceeded. Sonar
(Sound navigation and ranging) works on
similar principle for determining speed of
submarines using a sound source and sensitive
microphones.
Doppler ultrasonography and echo
cardiogram work on similar principle. Doctors
use an analogous set up to assess the direction
and speed of blood flow in a human body and
identify circulation problems. Measurement of
the dimension of the blood vessels can be used
to estimate the volume flow rate. Ultrasound
beams also determine phase shifts to diagnose
vascular problems in arteries and veins.
3] Unknown frequency of a sound note can
be determined by using the phenomenon
of beats. Initially the sound notes of
known and unknown frequency are heard
simultaneously. The known frequency
from a source of adjustable frequency
is adjusted in such a way that the beat
frequency reduces to zero. At this stage
frequencies of both the sound notes
become equal. Hence unknown frequency
can be determined.

Remember this
We can hear beats if the frequency difference
between the two superimposed waves is
very small (practically less than 6-7 Hz,
for normal human ear). At frequencies
higher than these, individual beats cannot
be distinguished from the sound that is
produced.

Take two tuning forks of the same
frequency.
Put some wax on the prongs of one of
the forks.
Vibrate both the tuning forks and keep
them side by side.
Listen to the periodic vibrations of
loudness of resulting sound.
How many beats have you heard in one
minute?
Can you guess whether frequency of
tuning fork is increased or decreased by
applying wax on the prong?
How you can find the new frequency of
the fork after applying wax on it.

6.9.2 Applications of beats :
1] The phenomenon of beats is used for
matching the frequencies of different
musical instruments by artists. They go
on tuning until no beats are heard by
their sensitive ears. When beat frequency
becomes equal to zero, the musical
instruments are in unison with each other
i.e., their frequencies are identical and the
effect of playing such instruments gives a
pleasant music.
2] The speed of an airplane can be determined
by using Doppler RADAR.

sound wave travels through a medium, there
are regions of compressions and rarefactions.
Thus there are changes in pressure. When
a sound is heard, say by a human, the wave
exerts pressure on the human ear. The pressure
variation is related to the amplitude and hence
to the intensity. Depending on the sound
produced, the variation in this pressure is
from 28 Pa for the loudest tolerable sound
to 2.0 × 10-5 Pa for the feeblest sound like
a whisper that can be heard by a human.
Intensity is a measurable quantity while
the sensation of hearing or loudness is very
subjective. It is therefore important to find
out how does a sound of intensity I affect a
detectable change ∆I in the intensity for the
human ear to note. It is known that the value
of such ∆I depends linearly on intensity I and
this fact allows humans to deal with a large
variation in intensity.
The response of human ear to sound is
exponential and not linear. It depends upon the
amount of energy crossing unit area around a
point per unit time. Intensity is proportional to
the square of amplitude. It also depends upon
various other factors like distance of source
from the listener, the motion of air, density of
medium, the surface area of sounding body etc.
The presence of other resonant objects around
the sounding body also affects loudness of
sound.
Scientifically, sound is specified not by its
intensity but by the sound level β (expressed in
decibles (dB)), defined as
 I 
--- (6.39)
  10 log10   , 		
 I0 
where I0 is a minimum reference intensity
(10-12 W/m2) that a normal human ear can hear.
Sound levels are then expressed in decibel
(dB). When I = I0, β = 0, thus the standard
reference intensity has measure of sound level
0 dB. The unit of difference in loudness is bel.
You have studied about this unit in XIth Std.

Example 6.12: Two sound waves having
wavelengths 81cm and 82.5 cm produce
8 beats per second. Calculate the speed of
sound in air.

6.10 Characteristics of Sound:
Sound has three characteristics: loudness,
pitch and quality.
1. Loudness: Loudness is the human perception
to intensity of sound. We know that when a
153

A sequence of frequencies which have a
specific relationship with each other is called
a musical scale. Normally both in Indian
classical music and western classical music,
eight frequencies, in specific ratio, form an
octave, each frequency denoting a specific
note. In a given octave frequency increases
along sa re ga ma pa dha ni så (as well as
along Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Dò). An example
of values of frequencies is 240, 270, 300, 320,
360, 400, 450, 480 Hz respectively.
6.11 Musical instruments:
Audible waves originate in vibrating
strings, vibrating air columns and vibrating
plates and membranes. Accordingly, musical
instruments are classified into three main types.
(a) Stringed instruments (b) wind instruments
(c) percussion instruments.
a) Stringed instruments: consist of stretched
strings. Sound is produced by plucking of
strings. The strings are tuned to certain
frequencies by adjusting tension in them. They
are further of three different types.
1) Plucked string type: In these instruments
string is plucked by fingers, e.g., tanpura,
sitar, guitar, veena, etc.
2) Bowed string type: In these instruments, a
string is played by bowing, e.g., violin, sarangi.
3) Struck string type: the string is struck by a
stick , e.g. santoor, piano.
b) Wind instruments: These instruments
consist of air column. Sound is produced by
setting vibrations of air column. They are
further of three different types
1) Freewind type: In these instruments free
brass reeds are vibrated by air. The air is
either blown or compressed. e.g., mouth organ,
harmonium etc.
2) Edge type: In these instruments air is blown
against an edge. e.g., Flute.
3) Reedpipes: They may consists of single
or double reeds and also instruments without
reeds .e.g., saxophone, clarinet (single reed),
bassoon (double reed), bugle (without reed).

1
bel
10
As mentioned above, minimum audible
sound is denoted by 0 dB while whispering
and normal speech have levels 10 dB and 60
dB respectively at a distance of approximately
1 m from the source. The intensity level of
maximum tolerable sound for a human ear is
around 120 dB.
Loudness is different at different
frequencies, even for the same intensity. For
measuring loudness the unit phon is used.
Phon is a measure of loudness. It is equal to
the loudness in decibel of any equally loud
pure tone of frequency 1000Hz.
2. Pitch: It is a sensation of sound which
helps the listener to distinguish between a high
frequency and a low frequency note. Pitch is
the human perception to frequency- higher
frequency denotes higher pitch. The pitch of
a female voice is higher than that of a male
voice.
3. Quality or timbre: Normally sound
generated by a source has a number of frequency
components with different amplitudes. Quality
of sound is that characteristic which enables
us to distinguish between two sounds of same
pitch and loudness. We can recognize the
voice of a person or an instrument due to its
quality of sound. Quality depends on number
of overtones present in the sound along with a
given frequency.
A sound which produces a pleasing
sensation to the ear is a musical sound. It is
produced by regular and periodic vibrations
without any sudden change in loudness.
Musical sound has certain well-defined
frequencies with sizable amplitude; these
are normally harmonics of a fundamental
frequency. A mixture of sounds of different
frequencies which do not have any relation
with each other produces what we call a noise.
Noise therefore is not pleasant to hear. If in
addition, it is loud, it may cause headaches.
1 decibel =

154

c)  Percussion
instruments:
In
these
instruments sound is produced by setting
vibrations in a stretched membrane. e.g., tabla,
drum, dhol, mridangam, sambal, daphali,etc.
They also consist of metal type of instruments
which produce sound when they struck against
each other or with a beater. e.g., cymbals (i.e.,
jhanja), xylophone, etc.
A blow on the membrane or plate or
plucking of string produces vibrations with
one fundamental and many overtones. A
superposition of several natural modes of
oscillations with different amplitudes and
hence intensities characterize different
musical instruments. We can thus distinguish
the instruments by their sounds.
Production of different notes by musical
instrument depends or the creation of
stationary waves. For a stringed instrument
such as guitar or sitar, the two ends of the
string are fixed. Depending as where the string
is plucked, stationary waves of various modes
midpoint minimum. In wind instruments, air
column is made to vibrate by blowing. By
changing the length of air column rote can be
charged. In wind instrument like flute, holes
can be uncovered to change the vibrations of
air column this changes the pattern of nodes
act antinodes.
In practice, sound produced is made up
of several stationary waves having different
patterns of nodes and antinodes. Musicians
skill is stimulating the string or air column to
produce direct mixture of frequencies.

7. Wave Optics
the image (whether real or virtual) depend on
the position of objects and the focal length of
the mirror or lens.
7.2 Nature of Light
7.2.1 Corpuscular Nature:
The formation of shadows as well
as images by mirrors and lenses has been
understood by considering rectilinear motion
of light rays. This fact led R. Descartes (15961650) to propose a particle nature of light in
the year 1636. Newton (1642-1726) developed
this concept further and proposed that light is
made up of particles, i.e., corpuscles which
are hard, elastic and massless. A source of
light emits these corpuscles which travel
along straight lines in the absence of any
external force. When the light corpuscles
strike a reflecting surface, they undergo elastic
collisions and as a result follow the laws of
reflection. During refraction, it is the difference
in the attractive force between the corpuscles
and the particles of the medium that causes
a change in the direction of the corpuscles.
A denser medium exerts a larger attractive
force on light corpuscles to accelerate them
along the normal to the boundary. Thus,
Newton’s theory predicted that the speed of
light in denser medium would be higher than
that in a rarer medium. This contradicts the
experimental observation. In this theory, light
of different colours corresponds to corpuscles
of different sizes. Newton performed several
experiments in optics and could explain their
results based on his theory. The study of
optical phenomena under the assumption that
it travels in a straight line as a ray is called
ray optics or geometrical optics as geometry is
used in this study. The laws of reflection and
refraction and the formation of images that
we studied in earlier standards fall under this
category.

Can you recall?
1. What does the formation of shadows
tell you about the propagation of light?
2. What are laws of reflection and
refraction?
3. What are electromagnetic waves?
4. What is the range of frequencies of
visible light?
5. What is meant by the phase at a point
along the path of a wave?
7.1 Introduction:
In earlier standards we have learnt that
light travels in a straight line while travelling
through a uniform and homogeneous medium.
The path of light is called a ray of light.
On encountering an interface with another
medium, a ray of light gets reflected or
refracted, changes its direction and moves
along another straight line. The reflection
is such that (i) the incident ray, the reflected
ray and the normal to the boundary surface at
the point of incidence are in the same plane
and (ii) the angle of incidence, i.e., the angle
between the incident ray and the normal to
the reflecting surface, is equal to the angle of
reflection, i.e., the angle between the reflected
ray and the normal. For refraction of light
while travelling from medium 1 to medium 2,
the laws are (i) the incident ray, the refracted
ray and the normal to the boundary between
the two media at the point of incidence are in
the same plane and (ii) the angle of incidence
i, and the angle of refraction r, are related
by n1 sin i = n2 sin r , where, n1 and n2 are the
absolute refractive indices of medium 1 and
medium 2 respectively.
We have also learnt about the reflection
of light produced by spherical mirrors and
refraction of light through prisms and curved
surfaces of lenses. The position and nature of
158

7.2.2 Wave Nature:
To circumvent the difficulties in
corpuscular theory, it was proposed by the
Dutch physicist C. Huygens (1629-1695) in
the year 1668, that light is a wave. Huygens
assumed light to be a wave caused by
vibrations of the particles of the medium. As
light could also travel in vacuum, he assumed
that a hypothetical medium, called ether is
present everywhere including in vacuum. Note
that this ether is not the substance (ether gas)
that we come across in chemistry. There was
however, no evidence to prove its existence
and thus, it was difficult to accept the concept.
In the nineteenth century, certain new
phenomena of light namely, interference,
diffraction and polarization were discovered.
These could not be explained based on
corpuscular theory and needed wave theory for
their explanation. Huygens’ theory could not
only explain the new phenomena but could also
explain the laws of reflection and refraction,
as well as the formation of images by mirrors
and lenses. It was then accepted as the correct
theory of light. Wave theory showed that if
the speed of light waves in denser medium is
smaller than that in rarer medium then light
bends towards normal. Thus, wave nature
of light could explain all the visual effects
exhibited by light. The branch of optics which
uses wave nature of light to explain the optical
phenomena is called wave optics.
In this chapter we are going to study wave
optics and learn how the laws of reflection
and refraction can be explained assuming the
wave nature of light. We will also learn about
the phenomena of interference, diffraction
and polarization and their explanation based
on wave optics. The reason why geometrical
optics works in case of formation of shadows,
reflection and refraction is that the wavelength
of light is much smaller than the reflecting/
refracting surfaces as well as the shadow

causing objects that one encounters in
laboratory or in day-to-day life.
In XIth Std we have learnt Maxwell's
equations which suggested that light is an
electromagnetic wave. As all waves known
till Maxwell’s time needed a medium to
propagate, Maxwell invoked the all-pervading
hypothetical medium ether. The existence of
radio waves and their speed being same as that
of visible light, were experimentally verified
by H. Hertz later in the nineteenth century.
Michelson and Morley performed several
experiments to detect ether but obtained
negative result. The hypothesized ether was
never detected, and its existence and necessity
was ruled out by Albert Einstein (18791955) when he proposed the special theory
of relativity in the year 1905, based on a
revolutionary concept of constancy of velocity
of light.
7.2.3 Dual Nature of Light:
In the early twentieth century, it was
accepted that light has a dual nature. It can
exhibit particle nature as well as wave nature
under different situations. Particles of light are
called photons. We will learn more about it in
Chapter 14.
7.3 Light as a Wave:
Light is an electromagnetic wave. These
waves are transverse in nature and consist of
tiny oscillating electric and magnetic fields
which are perpendicular to each other and to
the direction of propagation of the wave. These
waves do not require any material medium
for propagation and can even travel through
vacuum. The speed of light in a material
medium (v) depends on the refractive index
of the medium (n) which, in turn, depends on
permeability and permittivity of the medium.
The refractive index is equal to the ratio of
the speed of light in vacuum (c) to the speed
of light in the medium (v). The refractive
index of vacuum is 1 and that of air can be
approximated to be 1.
159

reactions (examples: firecrackers, nuclear
energy generators). Light originates in these
sources.
Secondary sources are those sources
which do not produce light of their own but
receive light from some other source and either
reflect or scatter it around. Examples include
the moon, the planets, objects like humans,
animals, plants, etc., which we see due to
reflected light. Majority of the sources that
we see in our daily life are secondary sources.
Most secondary sources are extended sources
as can be seen from the examples above.
7.4.2 Wavefront:
We have seen that when we drop a stone
in water, surface waves, commonly known as
ripples, are generated which travel outwards
from the point, say O, where the stone touches
water. Water particles along the path of the
wave move up and down, perpendicular to
the water surface. The phase of the wave at a
point is defined by the state of motion of the
particle at that point as well as the distance
of the point from the source (see Chapter 8 in
XIth Std book). Two particles are in phase, i.e.,
have the same phase if their state of motion is
the same, i.e., if they have the same velocity
and displacement perpendicular to the water
surface and if they are at the same distance
from the source. As the waves are travelling
symmetrically in all directions along the water
surface, all particles along the circumference
of a circle with centre at O will have the same
phase. The locus of all points having the same
phase at a given instant of time is called a
wavefront. Thus, a wavefront is the locus of all
points where waves starting simultaneously
from O reach at a given instant of time. In
case of water waves the wavefronts are circles
centred at O. The direction of propagation of
the wave is perpendicular to the wavefronts,
i.e., along the radii of the circle. The speed
with which the wavefronts move is the speed

Do you know?
It was shown by Einstein in his special
theory of relativity that the speed of light
(c) does not depend on the velocity of the
source of light or the observer. He showed
that no object or information can travel
faster than the speed of light in vacuum
which is 300,000 km/s.
Electromagnetic waves can have
wavelengths ranging from very small,
smaller than a femtometre (10-15 m), to very
large, larger than a kilometre. In the order
of increasing wavelength, the waves are
classified as γ-rays, X-rays, ultraviolet,
visible, infrared, microwave and radio waves.
Visible light comprises of wavelengths in
the 400-700 nm range. Waves of different
wavelengths in the visible range are perceived
by our eyes as different colours, with violet
having the shortest and red having the longest
wavelength. White light is a mixture of waves
of different wavelengths. The refractive index
of a medium depends on the wavelength used.
Because of this, for the same angle of incidence,
the angle of refraction is different for different
colours (except for normal incidence) and
therefore the colours present in the white light
get separated on passing through a transparent
medium. This is the reason for formation of a
spectrum and of a rainbow.
7.4 Huygens’ Theory:
7.4.1 Primary and Secondary Sources of
Light:
We see several sources of light around us,
e.g., the Sun, moon, stars, light bulb, etc. These
can be classified into primary and secondary
sources of light. Primary sources are sources
that emit light of their own, because of (i)
their high temperature (examples: the Sun,
the stars, objects heated to high temperatures,
flame of any kind, etc), (ii) the effect of current
being passed through them (examples: tube
light, TV, etc.), and (iii) chemical or nuclear
160

Let us now consider a spherical wavefront
which has travelled a large distance away
from the source. If we take a small portion this
wavefront, it will appear to be a plane surface
(just like the surface of the earth around us
appears to be flat to us) with the direction of
propagation perpendicular to it. In such a case
the wave is called a plane wave. Wavefronts
for a plane wave are shown in Fig.7.1 (b)
where the arrows (rays) which are now parallel
corresponding to a parallel beam of light, show
the direction of propagation of the wave. If the
source of light is linear (along a line) the wave
fronts will be cylindrical.
7.4.3 Huygens’ Principle:
Huygens had assumed light to be a wave,
similar to the mechanical wave like the water
wave or sound wave, propagating in ether.
Accordingly the particles of ether oscillate
due to the propagation of a light wave. He
put forth a principle which makes it possible
to determine the shape of a wavefront at any
time t, given its shape at an earlier time. This
principle can be stated as “Each point on a
wavefront acts as a secondary source of light
emitting secondary light waves called wavelets
in all directions which travel with the speed of
light in the medium. The new wavefront can
be obtained by taking the envelope of these
secondary wavelets travelling in the forward
direction and is thus, the envelope of the
secondary wavelets in forward direction. The
wavelets travelling in the backward direction
are ineffective”.
Given a wavefront at time t = 0 say, we
can determine the shape and position of a
wavefront at a later time t =T­ using Huygens’
principle. Let us first consider a plane
wavefront AB (corresponding to parallel
rays), at time t = 0 crosssection of which is
shown in Fig.7.2 (a). According to Huygens’
principle, each point on this wavefront will act
as a secondary source of light and will emit
spherical wavelets as shown in the figure. We

of the wave. Water waves are two dimensional
(along a surface) waves.
Three dimensional waves like the sound
waves produced by a source of sound, or light
waves produced by a light source, travel in all
directions away from the source and propagate
in three dimensions. Such a wave is called a
spherical wave. In these cases, the wavefronts
are surfaces passing through all points having
the same distance from the source and having
the same phase. Thus, in these cases, they
are spheres centred on the source say at O,
the cross sections of which are as shown in
Fig.7.1 (a). The spheres, the crosssections of
which are seen as circles in the figure are
wavefronts with the source at their centre.
The arrows are perpendicular to the spherical
surfaces and show the direction of propagation
of the waves. These arrows are the rays of
light that we have considered in earlier study
of optics. The wavefronts shown in the figure
correspond to a diverging beam of light. We
can similarly have wavefronts corresponding
to a converging beam of light. Such wavefronts
can be produced after passing through a lens.

Fig.7.1 (a): Spherical wavefronts corresponding
to diverging beam of light. These are spherical
waves. The source is at O.

parallel beam of light. These are plane waves.

have shown only the wavelets travelling in the
forward direction (direction of propagation
of light) as the backward travelling wavelets
are supposed to be ineffective. The wavelets
will be in the form of hemispheres and at a
later time t = T, the radius of the hemispheres
will be vT where v is the speed of light. The
wavefront at time T will be the envelope of
all these hemispherical wavelets and will be a
plane A′ B′ as shown in the figure. Similarly,
the position of a spherical wavefront at time t
= 0 is shown as AB in Fig.7.2 (b). The wavelets
emitted in the forward direction by points on
AB will be hemispheres as shown in the figure.
At time T the radius of these spheres will be vT
and their envelope will be a spherical surface
A′ B′ as shown.

plane reflecting surface (mirror) MN which
is also perpendicular to the plane of the paper
as shown in Fig.7.3. The figure shows a
cross section of the setup. RA and QB show
the direction of incidence. Let us assume
that the incident wavefront AB touches the
reflecting surface at A at time t = 0. The
point B will touch the reflecting surface at C
after a time t = T. Between time t = 0 and T,
different points along the incident wavefront
reach the reflecting surface successively and
secondary wavelets will start propagating in
the form of hemispheres from those points in
succession. For reflection, the hemispheres
to be considered are on the same side of the
mirror. The wavelet emitted by point A will
have a radius vT at time T. The radius of the
wavelet emitted by C will be zero at that time.
The radii of the wavelets emitted by points
between A and C will gradually decrease
from vT to 0. The envelope of these wavelets
forms the reflected wavefront. This is shown
by EC which is the common tangent to the
reflected wavelet originating from A and other
secondary wavelets emitted by points between
A and C.

Obviously, AE = BC = vT, the distance
travelled by light in the same medium in same
time. The arrow AE shows the direction
of propagation of the reflected wave. The
normal to MN at A is shown by AP, the angle
of incidence ∠RAP = i. As RA and AP are
perpendicular to AB and AC respectively,
∠BAC is also equal to i. The triangles ABC
and AEC are right angled triangles and have
common hypotenuse (AC) and one equal
side (AE = BC). Hence, the two triangles are
congruent and we have,

Fig.7.2 (b): Progress of a spherical wavefront.

Huygens’ theory is an empirical theory.
There is no reason why the backward travelling
waves will not be effective. The theory was
accepted just because it explained various
optical phenomena as we will see next.
7.5 Reflection of Light at a Plane Surface
Let us consider a plane wavefront AB
perpendicular to the plane of the paper,
incident at an angle i with the normal to a
162

∠ACE = ∠BAC = i.		
--- (7.1)
The angle of reflection is ∠PAE = r. As AE is
perpendicular to CE and AP is perpendicular
to AC,
∠ACE =∠PAE = r. 		
--- (7.2)
Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2) give us i = r which is the
law of reflection.
It is also clear from the figure that the
incident ray, normal and the reflected ray are
in the same plane which is the plane of the
paper. This is the other law of reflection.
Let us assume the rays, RA and QC to
be coming from the extremities of the object,
i.e., AB is the size of the object. The distance
between the corresponding reflected rays AE
and CF will be same as AB as can be seen from
the congruent triangles, ABC and AEC. Thus,
the size of the object in the reflected image will
be same as the actual size of the object.
Let us assume A and B to be the right and
left sides of the object respectively as it looks
into the mirror. After reflection, the right side,
at A is seen at E and the left side at B is seen
at C. As the right side has now become left
side and vice-versa as the image comes out
of the mirror. This is called lateral inversion.
Below we will see that lateral inversion does
not occur during refraction at a plane surface.

at C at a later time t = T. Let the speed of
light be v1 in medium 1 and v2 in medium 2.
Thus, BC = v1 T. At time t =T, the radius (AE)
of the secondary wavelet emitted from A will
be v2T. The refracted wavefront will be the
envelope of wavelets successively emitted by
all the points between A and C between time
t = 0 and t = T. CE is the tangent to the secondary
wavelet emitted from A. It is also the common
tangent to all the secondary wavelets emitted
by points between A and C. The normal to the
boundary at A is shown by PP′.
∠A′AP = ∠BAC = the angle of incidence = i
∠P′AE = ∠ACE = angle of refraction = r
From ΔABC,
sin i = v1 T /AC 			
--- (7.3)
From ΔAEC,
sin r = v2T /AC 			
--- (7.4)
From Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4) we get
sin i /sin r = v1 / v2 = (c/v2)/ (c/v1) = n2/n1,
n1 sin i = n2 sin r , 		
--- (7.5)
Here, n1 and n2 are the absolute refractive
indices of media 1 and 2 respectively. Eq. (7.5)
is the law of refraction and is also called the
Snell’s law. Also, it is clear from the figure
that the incident and refracted rays and the
normal to the boundary surface are in the same
plane. If v1 > v2, i.e., n1< n2. Then i > r. Thus,
during oblique incidence, the refracted ray will
bend towards the normal while going from an
optically rarer (smaller refractive index) to
an optically denser (higher refractive index)
medium. While entering an optically rarer
medium form a denser medium, the refracted
ray will bend away from the normal.
The refracted image will not be inverted
as can be seen from the diagram. Also, except
for normal incidence, the image seems to be
bent (broken) below the boundary surface as
the rays change their direction on crossing
the surface. At normal incidence, the rays
travel along the same direction and there is no
breaking of the image.

Fig.7.4: Refraction of light.

7.6. Refraction of Light at a Plane Boundary
Between Two Media :
Consider a wavefront AB, incident on a
plane boundary MN, separating two uniform
and optically transparent media as shown in
Fig 7.4. At time t = 0, A has just reached the
boundary surface, while B reaches the surface
163

CD which is at a distance of λ1 from AB, reach
PQ at time t = T. As the speed of the wave is v1
in medium 1 and T is the time period in which
the distance λ is covered by the wavefront , we
can write
T = λ1/v1			
--- (7.6)
In medium 2, the distance travelled by the
wavefront in time T will be λ2. The relation
between these two quantities will be given by
T = λ2/v2 			
--- (7.7)
Eq. (7.6) and Eq. (7.7) show that the
velocity in a medium is proportional to the
wavelength in that medium and give
λ 2 = λ1v2/v1= λ1 n1/n2 		
--- (7.8)
If medium 1 is vacuum where the
wavelength of light is λ0 and n is the refractive
index of medium 2, then the wavelength of
light in medium 2, λ, can be written as
λ= λ0v2/c = λ0/n 		
--- (7.9)
The ratio of the frequencies ν1 and ν2,
of the wave in the two media can be written,
using Eq. (7.8) as,
v1 / v2 = (v1/ λ1)/(v2/ λ2) = 1 --- (7.10)
This demonstrates that the frequency of
a wave remains unchanged while going from
one medium to another. Similar analysis goes
through if the wave is incident at an angle as
shown in Fig.7.5 (b).

Dependence of Wavelength on the Refractive
Index of the Medium:
Consider monochromatic light incident
normally on a boundary between a rarer
medium and a denser medium as shown in
Fig. 7.5 (a). The boundary between the two
surfaces is shown by PQ. The three successive
wavefronts AB, CD and EF are separated
by a distance λ1, which is the wavelength of
light in the first medium. After refraction, the
three wavefronts are indicated by A′B′, C′D′
and E′F′. Assuming the second medium to be
denser, the speed of light will be smaller in that
medium and hence, the wavefronts will move
slower and will be able to cover less distance
than that covered in the same time in the first
medium. They will therefore be more closely
spaced than in the first medium. The distance
between any two wavefronts is λ2, equal to
the wavelength of light in the second medium.
Thus, λ2 will be smaller than the wavelength
in the first medium. We can easily find the
relation between λ1 and λ2 as follows.

Remember this
The frequency of a wave is its fundamental
property and does not change while going
from one medium to another. The speed and
the wavelength of a wave do change and
are inversely proportional to the relative
refractive index of the second medium with
respect to the first.

Fig.7.5 (a): Change in wavelength of light
while going from one medium to another for
normal incidence.

oblique incidence.

7.7 Polarization:
We know that light is an electromagnetic
wave and that its electric (E) and magnetic (B)
field vectors are perpendicular to each other
and to the direction of propagation. We also
know that light is emitted by atoms. Thus,
when one atom emits a wave along the x-axis

Let the wavefront AB reach the boundary
surface PQ at time t = 0 and the next wavefront

used as polarizer. The particular direction
along which the electric field of the emergent
wave is oriented is called the polarizing axis
of the polarizer. This is shown in Fig.7.7 (a).
Thus, when unpolarized light passes through a
polarizer, the emergent light is plane polarized.
The plane ABCD containing the electric field
vector of plane polarized light is called the
plane of vibration while the plane perpendicular
to the plane of the vibration (horizontal plane)
is called plane of polarization.
If the polarized light is made to pass
through another polarizer with its polarizing
axis perpendicular to the polarizing axis of
the first polarizer, no light can emerge on
the other side as the second polarizer would
allow only waves having electric field parallel
to its polarizing axis to pass through. On the
other hand, if the polarizing axis of the second
polarizer makes an angle smaller than 90o with
that of the first polarizer, then the component
of the electric field of the polarized light along
the direction of the polarizing axis of the second
polarizer can pass through. The intensity of
light will reduce after passing through each
polarizer. We will mathematically calculate
this below. We have used the electric field
to explain the phenomenon of polarization,
however, it could also be explained in the
same manner using the magnetic field.

say, its electric field may be along the y-axis
and magnetic field will be along the z-axis.
However, if another atom in the source emits
a wave travelling along the x-axis, it is not
necessary that the electric field be along the
y-axis. It can be along any direction in the y-z
plane and the magnetic field will be along a
direction perpendicular to it. Thus, in general,
the electric fields of waves emitted along the
x-axis by a light source like the Sun, stars or
a light bulb will be in all possible directions in
the y-z plane and the corresponding magnetic
fields will be perpendicular to their electric
fields. Such light is called unpolarized light
and is represented by double headed arrows
(showing the directions of electric field) in
a plane perpendicular to the direction of
propagation. This is shown in Fig.7.6 (a) for a
light beam travelling perpendicular to the plane
of the paper. On the other hand, if somehow
light is constrained so that its electric field
is restricted along one particular direction,
then it is called plane polarized light. This is
shown in Fig.7.6 (b) for a light beam travelling
perpendicular to the plane of the paper.
How can we get polarized light? There
are certain types of materials which allow only

those light waves which have their electric
field along a particular direction to pass
through and block all other waves which have
their electric field in other directions. These
materials are called polarizers. A polaroid
is a kind of synthetic plastic sheet which is

Consider an unpolarized wave having

the wave (see Chapter 13 of the XIth Std book).
The intensity of the wave will be proportional
to |E0|2. The direction of the electric field
can be anywhere in the y-z plane we will
consider the passage of this wave through
two polarizers as shown in Fig. 7.7 (b). Let us
consider a particular wave having its electric
field at an angle φ to the axis of the first
polarizer. The component E0 cos φ will pass
through the first polarizer while the normal
component E0 sin φ will be obstructed. The
intensity of this particular wave after passing
through the polarizer will be proportional to
the square of its amplitude, i.e., to |E0 cos φ |2.
For unpolarized incident wave, φ can have all
values from 0 to 180o. Thus, to get the intensity
of the plane polarized wave emerging from the
first polarizer, we have to average |E0 cos φ |2
over all values of φ between 0 and 180o. The
value of the average of cos2 φ is ½. Hence,
the intensity of the wave will be proportional

Now if this wave passes through second
polarizer whose polarization axis makes
an angle θ with the y-direction, only the
component E10 cos θ will pass through. Thus,
the amplitude of the wave which passes
through (say E20) is now E10 cos θ and its
intensity I­2 will be
I2 ∝ |E20|2

I 2  E10 cos 2 , or I 2  I1cos 2 . --- (7.13)
This is known as Malus’ law after E. L.
Malus (1775-1812) who discovered the law
experimentally. Malus’ law gives the intensity
of a linearly polarized wave after it passes
through a polarizer.
Note that θ is the angle between the axes
of polarization of the two polarizers. If θ is
equal to zero, i.e., the polarization axes of the
two polarizers are parallel, the intensity does
not change while passing through the second
polarizer. If θ is 90o, cos 2θ is 0 and no light
emerges from the second polarizer. θ = 0o and
90o are known as parallel and cross settings of
the two polarizers.
Remember this
Only transverse waves can be polarized
while longitudinal waves cannot be
polarized. In transverse waves, the
oscillations can be along any direction
in a plane which is perpendicular to the
direction of propagation of the wave. By
restricting the oscillations to be along only
one direction in this plane, we get a plane
polarized wave. For longitudinal waves,
e.g., the sound wave, the particles of the
medium oscillate only along one direction,
which is the direction of propagation of the
wave, so there is nothing to restrict.

and hence are partially polarized. It was
experimentally discovered by D. Brewster in
1812 that for a particular angle of incidence
θ B (shown in the figure), the reflected wave
is completely plane polarized with its electric
field perpendicular to the plane of the paper
while the refracted wave is partially polarized.
This particular angle of incidence is called
the Brewster’s angle. For this angle of
incidence, the refracted and reflected rays are
perpendicular to each other. From the figure,

The phenomena of polarization by reflection is
used to cut out glare from the reflecting surfaces
using special sunglasses. Sunglasses are fitted
with polaroids which reduce the intensity of
the partially or fully polarized reflected light
coming to the eyes from reflecting surfaces.
As seen above, the intensity of Sunlight or
light coming from artificial sources which
is completely unpolarized is also reduced
to half by the polaroid. This phenomenon
of polarization by reflection works only for
nonmetallic surfaces.

Solution: The first polarizer, P1 will polarize
the incident unpolarized light. The intensity
after passing through this polarizer will be
I1 = I 0 /2 as discussed above. Let us assume
that the amplitude of the electric field after
passing through P1 is E10. While passing
through P2, a component of the electric field,
E20 = E10 cos θ1 will be able to pass through.
Thus, the intensity of light coming out of P2
will be I2= (I1 cos2 θ1 ) = ( I 0 cos 2 θ1 ) /2.

7.7.1 Polarization by Reflection: Brewster’s
Law:
When light is incident at an angle on a
boundary between two transparent media
having refractive indices n1 and n2, part of
it gets refracted and the rest gets reflected.
Let us consider unpolarized light incident
from medium of refractive index n1 on such
a boundary perpendicular to the plane of the
paper, as shown in Fig.7.8.

general, the reflected and refracted rays do not

polarizers and rotate one of them around
the path of light for one full rotation?

polaroid, you rotate both polaroids
simultaneously in the same direction?

7.8 Interference:
We have learnt about the superposition
of waves in Chapter 6. According to this
principle, when two or more waves overlap,
the resultant displacement of a particle of
the medium, at a given point is the sum of
the displacements of the particle produced by
individual waves, as if each wave is the only
one which is present. Because of this, particles
in the medium present where the crests (or
troughs) of the two waves coincide will have
larger displacements, while particles present
where the crest of one wave coincides with the
trough of the other, the displacement will be
minimum. If the amplitudes of the two waves
are equal, then for the first set of particles, the
displacement will be twice the amplitude of
the individual wave, and for the second set of
particles, the displacement will be zero. Thus,
the intensity of the wave which is proportional
to the square of the amplitude of the wave, will
be nonuniform, being larger at some places and
smaller at others. This is called interference.
Interference is shown in Fig.7.9 for
water waves. S1 and S2 are sources of water
waves of the same wavelength and amplitude,
and are in phase with each other, i.e., at any
given instant of time, the phases of the waves
emitted by both sources are equal. The crests
are shown by continuous circles while the
troughs are shown by dashed circles. Points
where the crest of one wave coincides with the
crest of another wave and where the trough
of one wave coincides with the trough of
another wave are shown by blue dots. At these
points the displacement is maximum and is
twice that for each wave. These are points of
constructive interference. The points where the
crest of one wave is coincident with the trough
of another are shown by red dots. At these
points, the displacement is zero. These are
points of destructive interference. Thus, along
some straight lines radially diverging from the

Example 7.2: For what angle of incidence
will light incident on a bucket filled with
liquid having refractive index 1.5 be

n1
n1 and n2 are refractive indices of the first
and the second medium respectively. In this
case, n1 = 1 and n2 = 1.5.
Thus, the required angle of incidence =

Brewster’s angle = tan −1
= 56.31o

7.7.2 Polarization by Scattering:
When Sunlight strikes air molecules or
dust particles in the atmosphere, it changes
its direction. This is called scattering. We see
the sky as blue because of this scattering as
blue light is preferentially scattered. If there
were no scattering, the sky would appear
dark to us as long as we do not directly
look at the Sun and we could see stars even
during the day. When Sunlight is scattered,
it gets partially polarized in a way similar to
the reflected light seen above (Fig. 7.8). The
degree of polarization depends on the angle of
scattering, i.e., the angle between the direction
of the light incident on the molecule or dust
particle and the direction of the scattered light.
If this angle is 90o, the scattered light is plane
polarized. Thus, the scattered light reaching us
from different directions in the sky is polarized
to different degrees.
Can you tell?
1. If you look at the sky in a particular
direction through a polaroid and rotate
the polaroid around that direction what
will you see?
2. Why does the sky appear to be blue
while the clouds appear white?
168

This criterion cannot be satisfied by two
independent primary sources as they emit
waves independently and there need not be a
constant phase relation between them. Thus,
to obtain sustained interference pattern one
usually obtains two secondary sources from
the same primary source as is done in Young’s
double slit experiment below.
7.8.2 Young’s Double Slit Experiment:
In this experiment, a plane wavefront is
made to fall on an opaque screen AB having
two similar narrow slits S1 and S2. The plane
wavefront can be either obtained by placing
a linear source S far away from the screen or
by placing it at the focus of a convex lens kept
close to AB. The rays coming out of the lens
will be parallel rays and the wavefront will
be a plane wave front as shown in Fig.7.10.
The figure shows a cross section of the
experimental set up and the slits have their
lengths perpendicular to the plane of the paper.
For better results, the slits should be about 2-4
mm apart from each other. An observing screen
PQ is placed behind of AB. For simplicity we
assume that the slits S1 and S2 are equidistant
from the S so that the wavefronts starting from
S and reaching the S1 and S2 at every instant of
time are in phase.

midpoint of S1S2, there is constructive (along
the radial lines connecting the blue dots) and
destructive (along the radial lines connecting
the red dots) interference. Interference had
been observed in the case of water waves and
sound waves. It was observed for light waves
in the laboratory for the first time by Thomas
Young (1773-1829) in the year 1801. As noted
above, this was the first proof of the wave
nature of light. We will discuss this below.

Fig.7.9: Interference for water waves.

7.8.1 Coherent Sources of Light:
Two sources which emit waves of the
same frequency having a constant phase
difference, independent of time, are called
coherent sources. At any given point in
space, at every instant of time, there are light
waves from multiple sources overlapping one
another. These must be interfering and we
should be able to see interference all around
us at all time. However, we see no interference
pattern. This is because different sources emit
waves of different frequencies and even if
they emit waves of the same frequency, they
are not in phase. Thus, the interference pattern
changes every instant of time and no pattern is
sustained over a significant length of time for
us to see.
For interference to be seen over sustained
periods,we need two sources of light which
emit waves of the same frequency and the
waves emitted by them are in phase or
have a constant phase difference between
them, i.e. we need coherent sources of light.

Fig. 7.10: Young’s double slit experiment.

When the rays fall on S1 and S2, the two
slits act as secondary sources of light emitting
cylindrical wavelets (with axis along the slit
length) to the right of AB. The two secondary
sources emit waves in phase with each other
at all times (as the waves falling on them are
in phase coming from a plane wavefront).

to the plane of the paper as shown at the right
in the Fig. 7.10.
Now let us determine the positions of
other bright fringes on the screen. Consider any
point P on the screen. The two wavelets from
S1 and S2 travel different distances to reach
P and so the phases of the waves reaching P
will not be the same. If the path difference (∆l)
between S1P and S2P is an integral multiple of
λ, the two waves arriving there will interfere
constructively producing a bright fringe at P.
If the path difference between S1P and S2P
is half integral multiple of λ, there will be
destructive interference and a dark fringe will
be located at P.
Considering triangles S1S1′P and S2S2′P, we
can write
( S 2 P ) 2  ( S1 P ) 2

The crests/troughs of the secondary wavelets
superpose as shown in the figure and interfere
constructively along straight lines joining the
blue dots as shown. The point where these
lines meet the screen have high intensity and
are bright. The images of the slits are also
perpendicular to the plane of the paper. The
image plane, rotated through 90° is shown on
the right side of the figure. Midway between
these lines are lines joining the red dots along
which the crest of one wave coincides with
the trough of the other causing zero intensity
and producing dark images of the slits on the
screen PQ. These are the dark regions on the
screen as shown on the right. The dark and
bright regions are called fringes and the whole
pattern is called interference pattern.
Let us now determine the positions and
intensities of the fringes mathematically. Let
us take the direction of propagation of the
plane waves incident on AB as x-axis. The
screen is along the y-z plane, y-axis being
along the plane of the paper. The origin of the
axes can be taken to be O, the central point
of S1 S2 as shown in Fig.7.11 which shows the
x-y cross section of the experimental setup. Let
the distance between the two slits S1 and S2 be
d and that between O and O′ be D. For better
results D should be about a metre for the slit
separation mentioned above.

The point O′ on the screen is equidistant

centres of the dark fringes, the intensity is zero.
At in between points, the intensity gradually
changes from zero to 4I0 and vice versa.
Thus, the interference fringes are equally
bright and equally spaced. This is however,
valid only in the limit of vanishing widths of
the slits. For wide slits, the waves reaching
a given point on the screen from different
points along a single slit differ in path lengths
travelled and the intensity pattern changes
resulting in a blurred interference pattern with
poor contrast.
We can calculate the intensity at a point
P on the screen where the phase difference
between the two waves is φ , as follows.
We can write the equations of the two
waves coming from S1 and S2, at the point P
on the screen as
E1 = E0 sin ω t and E2 = E0 sin  t   
The incident intensity I0 = |E0|2
The resultant electric field at P will be given
by E = E0 sin ω t + E0 sin  t    = 2 E0 cos
(φ / 2) sin  t   / 2  . The amplitude of the
wave is 2 E0 cos (φ / 2) .
Thus, the intensity at P will be proportional to
|2 E0 cos ( φ / 2) |2 and it will be equal to 4I0
cos2( φ / 2) .
Let us consider the case when the
amplitudes of the waves coming from the two
slits are different, E10and E20, say. In this case,
the intensities of the bright and dark bands will
be different from what is discussed above. At
the centre of the bright fringes, the amplitude
will be E10+ E20 and hence the intensity will be
proportional to |E10+ E20|2, while at the centres
of the dark fringes, the intensities will not be
zero but will be proportional to |E10- E20|2.
7.8.3 Conditions for Obtaining Well Defined
and Steady Interference Pattern:
The following conditions have to be
satisfied for the interference pattern to be
steady and clearly visible. Some of these have
already been mentioned above. However, we
list them all here for completeness.

Remember this
•

•

For the interference pattern to be clearly
visible on the screen, the distance (D)
between the slits and the screen should
be much larger than the distance (d)
between two slits, i.e., D>>d. We
have already used this condition while
deriving Eq.(7.16).
Conditions given by Eq.(7.16-7.19) and
hence the locations of the fringes are
derived assuming that the two sources
S1 and S­2­are in phase. If there is a
nonzero phase difference between them
it should be added appropriately. This
will shift the entire fringe pattern but
will not change the fringe widths.

Intensity distribution:
As there is constructive interference at the
centre of a bright fringe, the amplitude of the
wave is twice that of the original wave incident
on AB and the intensity, I, being proportional
to the square of the amplitude, is four times
the intensity of the incident wave I0 say. At the

1. The two sources of light should be
coherent. This is the essential condition
for getting sustained interference pattern.
As we have seen, the waves emitted by two
coherent sources are always in phase or
have a constant phase difference between
them at all times. If the phases and phase
difference vary with time, the positions
of maxima and minima will also change
with time and the interference pattern
will not be steady. For this reason, it is
preferred that the two secondary sources
used in the interference experiment are
derived from a single original source as
was shown in Fig.7.10.

the slits and the screen respectively. Thus,
we are given,

∆l A = y A = 0.0075 mm and ∆l B = y B
D
D
= 0.0015 mm, giving
y A = 0.0075 D/d and y B = 0.0015 D/d mm
Here, y A and y B are the distances of points
A and B from the centre of the screen.
Thus, the distance between the points A and
B is y A + y B = 0.009 D/d mm.
The width of a bright or dark fringe
(i.e., the distance between two bright or
two dark fringes) is given by W = λ D/d.
Thus, there will be (0.009 D/d)/W = 0.009/
λ = 0.009/(6000 x 10­-7) = 15 bright fringes
between A and B (including the central one)
and 14 dark fringes in between the bright
fringes.

find the distance between the slits.
Solution: Given: λ = 5500 Å, D = 2 m and
Distance between 10 fringes = 2 cm

Do you know?
Several phenomena that we come across in
our day to day life are caused by interference
and diffraction of light. These are the
vigorous colours of soap bubbles as well as
those seen in a thin oil film on the surface of
172

2. The two sources of light must be
monochromatic. As can be seen from
the condition for bright and dark fringes,
the position of these fringes as well as the
width of the fringes (Eq. (7.17), (7.18)
and (7.19)) depend on the wavelength of
light and the fringes of different colours
are not coincident. The resultant pattern
contains coloured, overlapping bands.
(In fact, original Young’s experiment was
with pin holes (not slits) and for sunlight,
producing coloured interference pattern
with central point as white).
3. The two interfering waves must have the
same amplitude. Only if the amplitudes
are equal, the intensity of dark fringes
(destructive interference) is zero and the
contrast between bright and dark fringes
will be maximum.
4. The separation between the two slits
must be small in comparison to the
distance between the plane containing
the slits and the observing screen. This
is necessary as only in this case, the width
of the fringes will be sufficiently large
to be measurable (see Eq.(7.19)) and the
fringes are well separated and can be
clearly seen.
5. The two slits should be narrow. If the
slits are broad, the distances from different
points along the slit to a given point on
the screen are significantly different and
therefore, the waves coming through the
same slit will interfere among themselves,
causing blurring of the interference
pattern.
6. The two waves should be in the same
state of polarization. This is necessary
only if polarized light is used for the
experiment. The explanation of this
condition is beyond the scope of this book.
7.8.4 Methods for Obtaining Coherent
Sources:
In Young’s double slit experiment, we
obtained two coherent sources by making the

water, the bright colours of butterflies and
peacocks etc. Most of these colours are
not due to pigments which absorb specific
colours but are due to interference of light

waves that are reflected by different
layers.
Interference due to thin films:
The brilliant colours of soap bubbles
and thin oil films on the surface of water
are due to the interference of light waves
reflected from the upper and lower
surfaces of the film. The two rays have
a path difference which depends on the
point on the film that is being viewed.
This is shown in the figure.
The incident wave gets partially
reflected from upper surface as shown by
ray AE. The rest of the light gets refracted
and travels along AB. At B it again gets
partially reflected and travels along BC.
At C it refracts into air and travels along
CF. The parallel rays AE and CF have
a phase difference due to their different
path lengths in different media. As can be
seen from the figure, the phase difference
depends on the angle of incidence θ1 , i.e.,
the angle of incidence at the top surface,
which is the angle of viewing, and also on
the wavelength of the light as the refractive
index of the material of the thin film
depends on it. The two rays AE and CF
interfere, producing maxima and minima
for different colours at different angles of
viewing. One sees different colours when
the film is viewed at different angles.
As the reflection is from the denser
boundary, there is an additional phase
difference of π radians (or an additional
path difference λ ). This should be taken
into account for mathematical analysis.

light from a single source pass through two
narrow slits. There are other ways to get two
coherent sources. We will discuss some of
those here.
i) Lloyd’s mirror: This is an extensively used
device. The light from a source is made to fall
at a grazing angle on a plane mirror as shown
in Fig.7.12. Some of the light falls directly on
the screen as shown by the blue lines in the
figure and some light falls after reflection, as
shown by red lines. The reflected light appears
to come from a virtual source and so we get
two sources. They are derived from a single
source and hence are coherent. They interfere
and an interference pattern is obtained as
shown in the figure. Note that even though we
have shown the direct and reflected rays by
blue and red lines, the light is monochromatic
having a single wavelength.

having obtained from a single secondary
source S. The two waves coming from S1 and
S2 interfere and form interference fringes like
that in Young’s double slit experiment in the
shaded region shown in the figure.
Example 7.5: An isosceles prism of
refracting angle 1790 and refractive index
1.5 is used as a biprism by keeping it
10 cm away from a slit, the edge of the
biprism being parallel to the slit. The slit
is illuminated by a light of wavelength 500
nm and the screen is 90 cm away from the
biprism. Calculate the location of the centre
of 20th dark band and the path difference at
this location.

ii) Fresnel biprism: A biprism is a prism
with vertex angle of nearly 180o. It can be
considered to be made up of two prisms with
very small refracting angle ranging from 30′
to 1o, joined at their bases. In experimental
arrangement, the refracting edge of the
biprism is kept parallel to the length of the slit.
Monochromatic light from a source is made
to pass through a narrow slit S as shown in
Fig.7.13 and fall on the biprism.

7.8.5 Optical Path:
The phase of a light wave having angular
frequency ω and wave vector k, travelling
in vacuum along the x direction is given by
(kx -ωt) (Eq.(7.11)). Remember that wave vector
k and the angular frequency ω are related as
k = ω/v, v being the speed of the wave, which
is c in vacuum. If the light wave travels a
distance Δx, its phase changes by Δ φ = kΔx
= ωΔx/v. If the wave is travelling in vacuum
k = ω/c and Δ φ = ωΔx/c. In case the wave
is travelling in a medium having a refractive
index n, then its wave vector k ′ and angular
frequency are related by k ′ = ω/v = ω/(c/n),
v being the speed of the wave in this medium.
Thus, if the wave travels a distance Δx in this
medium, the phase difference generated will
be
     Δ φ ′ = k′Δx = ωn Δx /c = ω Δx′ /c, --- (7.24)
where, Δx′= n Δx. 			
--- (7.25)
Thus, when a wave travels a distance Δx
through a medium having refractive index of
n, its phase changes by the same amount as
it would if the wave had travelled a distance
n Δx in vacuum. We can say that a path length
of Δx in a medium of refractive index n is
equivalent to a path length of n Δx in vacuum.
n Δx is called the optical path travelled by a
wave. Thus, optical path through a medium is
the effective path travelled by light in vacuum
to generate the same phase difference. In
vacuum, the optical path is equal to the actual
path travelled as n = 1.
Optical path in a medium can also be
defined as the corresponding path in vacuum
that the light travels in the same time as it
takes in the given medium.

refractive index n introduces a path difference
= nd – d = d(n – 1) over a ray travelling equal
distance through vacuum.
Two waves interfere constructively when
their optical path lengths are equal or differ by
integral multiples of the wavelength.
If we introduce a transparent plate of
thickness t and refractive index n in front of slit
S1 (Fig. 7.11), then the optical path travelled
by the wave along S1P is higher than that
travelled by the wave along S1P in absence
of the plate by (n-1)t. Thus, the optical path
lengths and therefore, the phases of the rays
reaching the midpoint O′ from S1 and S2 will
not be equal. The path lengths will be equal
at a point different than O′ and so the bright
fringe will not occur at O′ but at a different
point where the two optical path lengths are
equal. The dark and bright fringes will be
situated symmetrically on both sides of this
central fringe. Thus, the whole interference
pattern will shift in one direction.
Example 7.6: What must be the thickness
of a thin film which, when kept near one
of the slits shifts the central fringe by 5
mm for incident light of wavelength 5400
Å in Young’s double slit interference
experiment? The refractive index of the
material of the film is 1.1 and the distance
between the slits is 0.5 mm.
Solution: Given λ = 5400 Å, the refractive
index of the material of the film = 1.1 and
the shift of the central bright fringe = 5 mm.
Let t be the thickness of the film and P
be the point on the screen where the central
fringe has shifted. Due to the film kept in
front of slit S1 say, the optical path travelled
by the light passing through it increases
by t (1.1-1)= 0.1t. Thus, the optical paths
between the two beams passing through the
two slits are not equal at the midpoint of
the screen but are equal at the point P, 5
mm away from the centre. At this point the

it is applicable to sound waves as well. As
wavelengths of sound waves are larger,
diffraction of sound is easier to observe.
7.9.1 Fresnel and Fraunhofer Diffraction:
Diffraction can be classified into two
types depending on the distances involved in
the experimental setup.
1. Fraunhofer diffraction: If the distances
between the primary source of light, the
obstacle/slit causing diffraction and the
screen for viewing the diffraction pattern
are very large, the diffraction is called
Fraunhofer diffraction. In this case, the
wavefront incident on the obstacle can be
considered to be a plane wavefront. For
this, we generally place the source of light
at the focus of a convex lens so that a plane
wavefront is incident on the obstacle and
another convex lens is used on the other
side of the obstacle to make the pattern
visible on the screen. Figure 7.14 shows
this arrangement schematically.
2. Fresnel diffraction: In this case, the
distances are much smaller and the
incident wavefront is either cylindrical or
spherical depending on the source. A lens
is not required to observe the diffraction
pattern on the screen.
7.9.2 Experimental set up for Fraunhofer
diffraction:

distance travelled by light from the other slit
S2 to the screen is larger than that from S1 by
0.1t.
The difference in distances S2P – S1P = y
λ /d, where y is the distance along the screen
= 5 mm = 0.005 m and d is given to be 0.5
mm = 0.0005 m.
This has to be equal to the difference in
optical paths introduced by the film.
Thus, 0.1t = 0.005 x 5400 x 10-10/0.0005.
t = 5.4 x 10 -5m = 0.054 mm
7.9 Diffraction of Light:
We know that shadows are formed when
path of light is blocked by an opaque obstacle.
Entire geometrical optics is based on the
rectilinear propagation of light. However, as
discussed earlier, the phenomenon exhibited
by light such as interference can only be
explained by considering the wave nature of
light. Diffraction is another such phenomenon.
In certain experiments, light is seen to bend
around edges of obstacles in its path and enter
into regions where shadows are expected on
the basis of geometrical optics. This, so called
bending of light around objects, is called the
phenomenon of diffraction and is common to
all waves. We are very familiar with the fact
that sound waves travel around obstacles as
we can hear someone talking even though
there are obstacles, e.g. a wall, placed between
us and the person who is talking. As we will
see below, light actually does not bend around
edges in diffraction, but is able to reach the
shadow region due to the emission by the
secondary sources of light on the edge of the
obstacle. The phenomenon of diffraction
is intimately related to that of interference.
Diffraction is essentially the interference of
many waves rather than two which we have
encountered in interference. Also, diffraction
is noticeable only when the size of the obstacle
or slits is of the order of the wavelength of

Fig. 7.14: Set up for fraunhofer diffraction .

Figure 7.14 shows a monochromatic
source of light S at the focus of a converging
lens. Ignoring aberrations, the emerging beam
will consist of plane parallel rays resulting in
176

Location of minima and maxima: Figure
7.15 is a part of figure 7.14. It shows two sets
of parallel rays originating at the slit elements.
The central and symmetric beam focuses at
the central point (line) P0, directly in front of
O, the center of the slit.
Rays parallel to the axis from all points
from A to B are focused at the central point
P0. Thus, all these rays must be having equal
optical paths. Hence all these arrive at P0
with the same phase, and thereby produced
constructive interference at P0.
In the case of point P at angular position
θ the optical paths of the rays from A to C till
point P are equal as AC is normal to AM. From
this points onwards, there is no path difference
or phase difference between these rays. Hence,
the paths of rays between AB and AC are
responsible for the net path difference or phase
difference at point P. The path difference
between extreme rays is BC  a sin  . Let this
be equal to λ .

1
Let K be the midpoint of AC.  OK  BC

2
Thus, the path difference between AP and OP
is λ / 2. As a result, these two rays (waves)
produce destructive interference at P. Now
consider any pair of points equidistant
respectively from A and O, such as G and H,
separated by distance a /2 along the slit. Rays
(waves) from any such pair will have a path
difference of λ /2 at P. Thus, all such pairs
of points between AO and OB will produce
destructive interference at P. This makes point
P to be the first minimum.
This discussion can be extended to points
on the screen having path differences 2 λ , 3
λ , … n λ between the extreme rays reaching
them and it can be seen that these points will
be dark and hence will be positions of dark
fringes.
Again, the same logic is applicable for
points on the other side of P0.

plane wavefronts. These are incident on the
diffracting element such as a slit, a circular
aperture, a double slit, a grating, etc. Emerging
beam is incident on another converging lens
that focuses the beam on a screen.
In the case of a circular aperture, S is a
point source and the lenses are bi-convex.
For linear elements like slits, grating, etc., the
source is linear and the lenses are cylindrical
in shape so that the focussed image is also
linear. In either case, a plane wavefront (as
if the source is at infinity) approaches and
leaves the diffracting element. This is as per
the requirements of Fraunhofer diffraction.
7.9.3 Fraunhofer Diffraction at a Single Slit:
Figure 7.14 shows the cross section of a
plane wavefront YY′ incident on a single slit
of width AB. The centre of the slit is at point
O. As the width of the slit is in the plane of the
paper, its length is perpendicular to the paper.
The slit can be imagined to be divided into a
number of extremely thin slits (or slit elements).
The moment the plane wavefront reaches the
slit, each slit element becomes the secondary
source of cylindrical wavefronts responsible
for diffraction in all possible directions. A
cylindrical lens (with its axis parallel to the
slit) kept next to the slit converges the emergent
beams on to the screen kept at the focus. The
distance D between the slit and the screen is
practically the focal length F of the lens. For
all practical set ups, the width a of the slit is of
the order of 10-4 to 10-3 m and distance D is of
the order of 10 m, i.e., D >> a.

Do you know?
Why did we use λ as the path difference
between the waves originating from
extreme points for the first minima?
• On receiving energy from two waves, at
the position of the first dark fringe, the
path difference between the two waves
must be λ /2. In the case of a single slit,
a point on the screen receives waves
from all the points on the slit. For the
point on the screen to be dark, there must
be a path difference of λ /2 for all pairs
of waves. One wave from this pair is
from upper half part of the slit and the
other is from the lower half e.g., points
A and O, G and H, O and B, etc. Thus,
the minimum path difference between
the waves originating from the extreme
points A and B must be      .
2 2
In reality, these are nearly midway and
not exactly midway between the dark fringes.
Distances of minima and maxima from the
central bright point,(i.e., the distances on the
screen):
Equations (7.26) and (7.27) relate the
path difference at the locations of nth dark
and nth bright point respectively. As described
earlier, the distance D >>a. Hence the angle θ
is very small. Thus, if it is expressed in radian,

7.9.4 Comparison of Young’s Double
Slit Interference Pattern and Single Slit
Diffraction Pattern:
For a common laboratory set up, the
slits in the Young’s double slit experiment
are much thinner than their separation. They
are usually obtained by using a biprism or a
Lloyd’s mirror. The separation between the
slits is a few mm only. With best possible set
up, we can usually see about 30 to 40 equally
spaced bright and dark fringes of nearly same
brightness.
The single slit used to obtain the
diffraction pattern is usually of width less
than 1 mm. Taken on either side, we can see
around 20 to 30 fringes with central fringe
being the brightest. Also, width of the central
178

bright fringe is twice that of all the other bright
between interference and diffraction patterns

fringes (in the single slit diffraction pattern).

Double slit diffraction pattern:
What pattern will be observed due to
diffraction from two slits rather than one? In
this case the pattern will be decided by the
diffraction pattern of the individual slits, as
well as by the interference between them. The
pattern is shown in Fig.7.16 (c). There are
narrow interference fringes similar to those in
Young’s double slit experiment, but of varying
brightness and the shape of their envelope is
that of the single slit diffraction pattern.
7.10 Resolving Power:
Diffraction effect is most significant while
discussing the resolving power of an optical
instrument. We use an optical instrument to
see minor details of all the parts of an object
or to see distinct images of different nearby
objects and not only for magnification.
Consider your friend showing two of her
fingers (as we do while showing a victory sign)
from a distance less than 10 m. You can easily
point out that she is showing two fingers, i.e.,
you can easily distinguish the two fingers.
However, if she shows the same two fingers
from a distance over 50 m, most of you will
NOT be able to distinguish the two fingers,
i.e., you can’t definitely say whether those are
two fingers or it is a single finger.
This ability to distinguish two physically
separated objects as two distinct objects is
known as the resolving power of an optical
instrument. In the example given, it was your
eye. In other words, from a distance less than
10 m, your eye is able to resolve the two
fingers. From beyond 50 m, it may not possible
for you to resolve the two fingers.
Resolving power of an optical instrument
(an eye, a microscope, a telescope, etc.)
generally depends upon the aperture (usually
the diameter of the lens or mirror) and the
wavelength of the light used. In general, the
resolving ability of an instrument is stated in
terms of the visual angle, which is the angle
subtended at the eye by the two objects to

be resolved (which are assumed to be point
objects). It is the minimum visual angle
between two objects that can be resolved by
that instrument. This minimum angle is called
limit of resolution. Reciprocal of the limit of
resolution is called the resolving power.
7.10.1 Rayleigh’s Criterion for Limit of
Resolution (or for Resolving Power):
According to Lord Rayleigh, the ability
of an optical instrument to distinguish between
two closely spaced objects depends upon the
diffraction patterns of the two objects (slits,
point objects, stars, etc.), produced at the
screen (retina, eyepiece, etc.). According to this
criterion, two objects are just resolved when the
first minimum of the diffraction pattern of one
source coincides with the central maximum of
the diffraction pattern of the other source, and
vice versa.

Fig. 7.17 Rayleigh’s criterion for resolution
of objects.

In Fig. 7.17(b), first minimum of the
diffraction pattern of second object is
coinciding with the central maximum of the
first and vice versa. In such case we find the
objects to be just resolved as the depression in
the resultant envelopee is noticeable. For Fig
7.17(a), the depression is not noticeable and in
Fig 7.17(c), it can be clearly noticed.
(i) Two linear objects: Consider two self
luminous objects (slits) separated by some
distance. As per Rayleigh’s criterion, the first
minimum of the diffraction pattern of one of
the sources should coincide with the central
maximum of the other. Graphical pattern of
the diffraction by two slits at the just resolved
condition is as shown in the lower half of the
180

According to Lord Rayleigh, for such
objects to be just resolved, the first dark ring of
the diffraction pattern of the first object should
be formed at the centre of the diffraction
pattern of the second, and vice versa. In other
words, the minimum separation between the
images on the screen is radius of the first dark
ring (Fig. 7.17 (b) and Fig. 7.19 (a))
The discussion till here is applicable to
any instrument such as an eye, a microscope,
a telescope, etc.
7.10.2 Resolving Power of a Microscope:
Fig 7.19 shows two point objects O
and O′ separated by a distance a in front of
an objective AB of a microscope. Medium
between the objects and the objective is of
refractive index n. Wavelength of the light
emitted by the sources in the medium is λn .
Angular separation between the objects, at the
objective is 2 α .

Fig 7.17(b). Angular separation (position) of
the first principal minimum is

d  			--- (7.28)
a
As this minimum coincides with the
central maximum of the other, this must be the
minimum angular separation between the two
objects, and hence the limit of resolution of
that instrument.

It is obviously the distance of the first
minimum from the centre.
(ii) Pair of Point objects: In the case of a
microscope, quite often, the objects to be
viewed are similar to point objects. The
diffraction pattern of such objects consists of
a central bright disc surrounded by concentric
rings, called Airy disc and rings as shown
in Fig. 7.18 (a). Abbe was the first to study
this thoroughly, and apply it to Fraunhofer
diffraction.

microscope.

formation of Airy disc and rings.

O and O′ in Fig. 7.19 (a).

Figure (7.18 (b)) shows a real Airy disk
formed by passing a red laser beam through
a 90 µm pinhole aperture that shows several
orders (rings) of diffraction.
181

I and I′ are centers of diffraction patterns
(Airy discs and rings) due to O and O′ on the
screen (effectively at infinity). According to
Rayleigh's criterion the first dark ring due to
O′ should coincide with I and that of O should
coincide with I′. The nature of illumination
at a point on the screen is decided by the

effective path difference at that point. Let us
consider point I where first dark ring due to O′
is located. Paths of the extreme rays reaching
I from O′ are O′AI and O′BI. As point I is
symmetric with respect to O, the paths AI and
BI are equal. Thus, the actual path difference
is O′B - O′A.
The region around O′ and O is highly
enlarged in Fig. 17.19 (b). From this figure it
can proved that
path difference = DO′ + O′C
= 2 a sinα 		
--- (7.30)
(i) Microscope with a pair of non-luminous
objects (dark objects): In common microscopy,
usually self-luminous objects are not observed.
Non-luminous objects are illuminated by some
external source. In general, this illumination is
not normal, but it is oblique. Also majority of
the objects viewed through a microscope can be
considered to be point objects producing Airy
rings in their diffraction patterns. Often the eye
piece is filled with some transparent material.

Do you know?
• The expression of resolving power of a
microscope is inversely proportional to
the wavelength λ used to illuminate the
object. Can we have a source with a very
small wavelength compared to that of
the visible light?
• You will study later in Chapter 14 that
electrons exhibit wave like behaviour.
By controlling the speed of the electrons,
we can control their wavelength. This
principle is used in Electron Microscopes.
Modern electron microscopes can have
a magnification ∼106 and can resolve
objects with separation < 10 nm. For
ordinary optical microscopes the
minimum separation is generally around
10-3 mm.
7.10.3 Resolving Power of a Telescope:
Telescopes are normally used to see distant
stars. For us, these stars are like luminous
point objects, and are far off. Thus, their
diffraction patterns are Airy discs. Also, as the
objects to be seen are far off, only the angular
separation between the two is of importance
and not the linear separation between them.
Fig. 7.20 shows objective AB of a telescope
receiving two sets of parallel beams from two
distant objects with an angular separation θ .
Resolving power of a telescope is then defined
as the reciprocal of the least angular separation
between the objects that are just resolved.
According to Rayleigh’s criterion, the
minimum separation between the images I and
I′ must be equal to the radius of the first dark
Airy ring.

The factor n sin α is called numerical
aperture (N. A.).

The highest angular resolution achievable
ranges from about 60 arcsec (arcsec is3600th
part of a degree) at the lowest frequency of 50
MHz to about 2 arcsec at 1.4 GHz.

Thus, to increase the resolving power of a
telescope (for a given wavelength), its objective
(aperture) should be as large as possible.
Using a large lens invites a lot of difficulties
such as aberrations, initial moulding of the
lens, post launch issues such as heavy mass
for changing the settings, etc. The preferred
alternative is to use a front coated curved
mirror as the objective. As discussed in XIth Std.
a parabolic mirror is used in order to eliminate
the spherical aberration. Again, constructing
a single large mirror invites other difficulties.
Recent telescopes use segmented mirrors that
have a number of hexagonal segments to form
a large parabolic mirror. Two largest optical
telescopes under construction have 30 m and
40 m for the diameters of their mirrors.
Radio Telescope: Wavelengths of radio waves
are in metres. According to Eq. (7.35), if we
want to have same limit of resolution as that
of an optical telescope, the diameter (aperture)
of the radio telescopes should be very large
(at least some kilometers). Obviously a single
disc of such large diameters is impracticable.
In such cases arrays of antennae spread over
several kilometres are used. Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) located at
Narayangaon, near Pune, Maharashtra uses

Example 7.7: A telescope has an objective of
diameter 2.5 m. What is its angular resolution
when it observes at 5500 Å?
Solution: Angular resolution, Δ θ = 1.22 λ /a,
a being the diameter of the aperture
= 1.22 x 5.5 x 10-7 / 2.5 = 2.684 x 10-7 rad
= 0.06 arcsec
Example 7.8: What is the minimum distance
between two objects which can be resolved
by a microscope having the visual angle of
300 when light of wavelength 500 nm is used?
Solution: According to Eq. (7.33) the
minimum distance is given by
dmin = 0.61 λ /tan b
dmin = 0.61 x 5.0 x 10-7/tan 30o = 5.28 x 10-7 m.

charge configurations with the help of some
examples.

Can you recall?
1. What are conservative forces?
2. What is potential energy ?
3. What is Gauss’ law and what is a
Gaussian surface?

8.2.1 Electric Field Intensity due to Uniformly
Charged Spherical Shell or Hollow Sphere:

Consider a sphere of radius R with its
centre at O, charged to a uniform charge
density σ (C/m2 ) placed in a dielectric medium
of permittivity ε (ε = ε 0 k ) . The total charge
on the sphere, q = σ × 4πR2
By Gauss’ theorem, the net flux through a
closed surface
φ = q/ε0 (for air/vaccum k=1)
where q is the total charge inside the closed
surface.

8.1 Introduction:
In XIth Std we have studied the Gauss’
Law which gives the relationship between
the electric charge and its electric field. It
also provides equivalent methods for finding
electric field intensity by relating values of the
field at a closed surface and the total charges
enclosed by that surface. It is a powerful tool
which can be applied for the calculation of the
electric field when it originates from charge
distribution of sufficient symmetry. The law
can be written as

  E  ds 		
--- (8.1)

where φ is the total flux coming out of a
closed surface and q is the total charge inside
the closed surface.

Fig. 8.1: Uniformly charged spherical shell or
hollow sphere.

To find the electric field intensity at
a point P, at a distance r from the centre of
the charged sphere, imagine a concentric
Gaussian sphere of radius r passing through
P. Let ds be a small area around the point P
on the Gaussian surface. Due to symmetry and
spheres being concentric, the electric field at
each point on the Gaussian surface has the
same magnitude E and it is directed radially
outward. Also, the angle between the direction
of E and the normal to the surface of the sphere
(ds) is zero i.e., cos θ = 1
 
∴ E . ds = E ds cos θ = E ds

Common steps involved in calculating
electric field intensity by using Gauss’
theorem:
1. Describe the charge distribution
(linear/surface/volume)
2. Obtain the flux by Gauss’ theorem (Let
this be Eq. (A))
3. Visualize a Gaussian surface and justify
it.
4. With the electric field intensity E
as unknown, obtain electric flux by
calculation, using geometry of the
structure and symmetry of the Gaussian
surface (Let this be Eq. (B))
5. Equate RHS of Eq. (A) and Eq. (B) and
calculate E.
8.2 Application of Gauss' Law:

the electric field intensity for some symmetric

∴E = σR2 / ε 0 r
		
--- (8.4)
From Eqn. (8.3) it can be seen that, the
electric field at a point outside the shell is the
same as that due to a point charge. Thus it can
be concluded that a uniformly charged sphere
is equivalent to a point charge at its center.
Case (i) If point P lies on the surface of the
charged sphere: r = R
∴ E= q/ 4 0 R 2 =σ/ ε 0
Case (ii) If point P lies inside the sphere: Since
there are no charges inside σ = 0,
∴ E = 0.
Example : 8.1

1µC. Calculate the electric field
(i) at a distance of 30 cm from the center
of the sphere

To find the electric field intensity at P ,at
a distance r from the charged wire, imagine
a coaxial Gaussian cylinder of length l and
radius r (closed at each end by plane caps
normal to the axis) passing through the point
P. Consider a very small area ds at the point P
on the Gaussian surface.
By symmetry, the magnitude of the
electric field will be the same at all the points
on the curved surface of the cylinder and
will be directed radially outward. The angle
between the direction of E and the normal to
the surface of the cylinder (ds) is zero i.e.,

Can you recall?
What is gravitational Potential ?
8.3 Electric Potential and Potential Energy:
We have studied earlier that the potential
energy of a system is the stored energy that
depends upon the relative positions of its
constituents. Electrostatic potential energy is
the work done against the electrostatic forces
to achieve a certain configuration of charges
in a given system. Since every system tries
to attain the lowest potential energy, work
is always required to be done to change the
configuration.

Fig. 8.4: Charged infinite plane sheet.

To find the electric field due to a charged
infinite plane sheet at P, we consider a
Gaussian surface around P in the form of a
cylinder having cross sectional area A and
length 2r with its axis perpendicular to the
plane sheet. The plane sheet passes through
the middle of the length of the cylinder such
that the ends of the cylinder (called end caps
P and P') are equidistant (at a distance r) from
the plane sheet.

We know that like charges repel and unlike
charges attract each other. A charge exerts a
force on any other charge in its vicinity. Some
work is always done to move a charge in the
presence of another charge. Thus, potential
energy arises from any collection of charges.
Consider a positive charge Q fixed at some
point in space. For bringing any other positive
charge close to it, work is necessary. This work
is equal to the change in the potential energy
of their system.
Thus, work done against a electrostatic force =
Increase in the potential energy of the system.

where dU is the increase in potential energy

Thus the electric field at a point in an
electric field is the negative of the potential
gradient at that point.
Zero potential:
The nature of potential is such that its
zero point is arbitrary. This does not mean
that the choice of zero point is insignificant.
Once the zero point of the potential is set,
then every potential is measured with respect
to that reference. The zero potential is set
conveniently.
In case of a point charge or localised
collection of charges, the zero point is set at
infinity. For electrical circuits the earth is
usually taken to be at zero potential.
Thus the potential at a point A in an
electric field is the amount of work done to
bring a unit positive charge from infinity to
point A.

Relation between electric field and electric

calculate the work done to move a unit positive
charge from point M to point N which is at a
small distance dx from M. The direction of

Example 8.4: Potential at a point A in

located at point O. We need to determine its
potential at a point A, at a distance r from it.

As seen above the electric potential at a
point A is the amount of work done per unit
positive charge, which is displaced from ∞ to
point A. As the work done is independent of
the path, we choose a convenient path along
the line extending OA to ∞.

b) Electric potential due to an electric dipole:
We have studied electric and magnetic
dipoles in XIth Std. Figure 8.8 shows an
electric dipole AB consisting of two charges
+q and -q separated by a finite distance 2ℓ.

Its dipole moment is p, of magnitude p = q ×
2l, directed from -q to +q. The line joining the
centres of the two charges is called dipole axis.
A straight line drawn perpendicular to the axis
and passing through centre O of the electric
dipole is called equator of dipole.
In order to determine the electric potential
due to a dipole, let the origin be at the centre
(O) of the dipole.

the minimum value of the magnitude of the

Thus the plane perpendicular to the line
between the charges at the midpoint is an
equipotential plane with potential zero. The
work done to move a charge anywhere in this
plane (potential difference being zero) will be
zero.

We now extend the analysis to a system of

Use your brain power
Is electrostatic potential necessarily zero at
a point where electric field strength is zero?
Justify.

8.5 Equipotential Surfaces:
An equipotential surface is that surface,
at every point of which the electric potential is
the same. We know that,
The potential (V) for a single charge q is
given by V = 1 q

Example 8.8: Two charges 5 × 10-8 C and
-3 × 10-8 C are located 16 cm apart. At what
point (s) on the line joining the two charges
is the electric potential zero ? Take the
potential at infinity to be zero.
Solution : As shown below, suppose the two
point charges are placed on x- axis with the
positive charge located at the origin O.
q1= 5 × 10-8 C

4 0 r

If r is constant then V will be constant.
Hence, equipotential surfaces of single point
charge are concentric spherical surfaces
centered at the charge. For a line charge, the
shape of equipotential surface is cylindrical.

q2= -3 × 10-8 C

Let the potential be zero at the point P and
OP = x. For x < 0 ( i.e. to the left of O), the
potentials of the two charges cannot add up
to zero. Clearly, x must be positive. If x lies
between O and A, then
V1 + V2 = 0, where V1 and V2 are the
potentials at points O and A, respectively.
q1= 5 × 10-8 C

Fig. 8.10 : Equipotential surfaces.

q2= -3 × 10-8 C

Equipotential surfaces can be drawn
through any region in which there is an electric
field.
By definition the potential difference
between two points P and Q is the work done
per unit positive charge displaced from Q to P.
∴ VP – VQ = WQP
If points P and Q lie on an equipotential
surface, Vp = VQ.
∴ WQP = 0
Thus, no work is required to move a test
charge along an equipotential surface.

equipotential surface through which unit
positive charge is carried then

Hence electric field intensity E is always
normal to the equipotential surface i.e., for any
charge distribution, the equipotential surface
through a point is normal to the electric field
at that point.

identical positive charges.

b) If the field is not normal, it would have a
nonzero component along the surface. So to
move a test charge against this component
work would have to be done. But by the
definition of equipotential surfaces, there
is no potential difference between any two
points on an equipotential surface and hence
no work is required to displace the charge on
the surface. Therefore, we can conclude that
the electrostatic field must be normal to the
equipotential surface at every point, and vice
versa.

sheets.

Do you know?
Equipotential surfaces do not intersect each
other as it gives two directions of electric
fields at intersecting point which is not possible.

charged metallic sphere.

Like the lines of force, the equipotential
surface give a visual picture of both the
direction and the magnitude of electric field in
a region of space.

negative charge of 1.6 × 10-19 C is suspended
in equilibrium between two horizontal
metal plates 10 cm apart having a potential

To calculate the electric potential energy
of the two charge system, we assume that the
two charges q1 and q2 are initially at infinity.
We then determine the work done in bringing
the charges to the given location by an external
agency.
In bringing the first charge q1 to position
A r1 , no work is done because there is no
external field against which work needs to be

8.6 Electrical Energy of Two Point Charges
and of a Dipole in an Electrostatic Field:
When two like charges lie infinite distance
apart, their potential energy is zero because
no work has to done in moving one charge at
infinite distance from the other. But when they
are brought closer to one another, work has
to be done against the force of repulsion. As
electrostatic force is conservative, this work
gets stored as the potential energy of the two
charges. Electrostatic potential energy of
a system of point charges is defined as the
total amount of work done to assemble the
system of charges by bringing them from
infinity to their present locations.

b) Potential energy for a system of N point
charges:
Equation (8.16) gives an expression for
potential energy for a system of two charges.
We now analyse the situation for a system of
N point charges.
 In bringing a charge q3 from ∞ to C
( r3 ) work has to be done against electrostatic
forces of both q1and q2
∴ W3 = (potential at C due to q1 and q2 )× q3

(c) Potential energy of a single charge in an
external field:
Above, we have obtained an expression
for potential energy of a system of charges
when the source of the electric field, i.e.,
charges and their locations, were specified.
In this section, we determine the potential
energyof a charge (or charges) in an external
field E which is not produced by the given
charge (or charges) whose potential energy we
wish to calculate. The external sources could
be known, unknown or unspecified, but what is
known is the electric field E or the `electrostatic
potential V due to the external sources.
Here we assume that the external field
is not affected by the charge q, if q is very
small. The external electric field E and the
corresponding external potential V may vary
from point to point.

If V ( r ) is the external potential at any

point P having position vector r , then by
definition, work done in bringing a unit positive
charge from ∞ to the point P is equal to V.
∴ Work done in bringing a charge q, from ∞
to the given
point in the external field

is qV ( r ).
This work is stored in the form of potential
energy of a system of charge q.

∴PE of a system of a single charge q at r in

(d) Potential energy
of a system of two
charges in an external field:
In order to find the potential energy of
a system of two charges q1 and q2 located at
r1 and r2 respectively in an external field, we
calculate the work done in bringing the charge
q1 from ∞ to r1.
From (8.17),in the said process work done
= q1V ( r ) 		
--- (8.18)
To bring the charge q2 to r2, the work is
done not only against the external field E but
also against the field due to q1.

8.7 Conductors and Insulators, Free Charges
and Bound Charges Inside a Conductor:
a) Conductors and Insulators:
When you come in contact with wires in
wet condition or while opening the window of
your car, you might have experienced a feeling
of electric shock. Why don’t you get similar
experiences with wooden materials?
The reason you get a shock is that
there occurs a flow of electrons from one body
to another when they come in contact via
rubbing or moving against each other. Shock
is basically a wild feeling of current passing
through your body.
Conductors are materials or substances
which allow electricity to flow through them.
This is because they contain a large number
of free charge carriers (free electrons). In a
metal the outer (valence) electrons are loosely
bound to the nucleus and are thus free for
conductivity, when an external electric field is
applied.
Metals, humans, earth and animal bodies
are all conductors. The main reason we get
electric shocks is that being a good conductor
our human body allows a resistance free path
for the current to flow from the wire to our
body.
Under electrostatic conditions the conductors
have following properties.
1. In the interior of a conductor, net
electrostatic field is zero.
2. Potential is constant within and on the
surface of a conductor.
3. In static situation, the interior of a
conductor can have no charge.
4. Electric field just outside a charged
conductor is perpendicular to the surface
of the conductor at every point.
5. Surface charge density of a conductor
could be different at different points.

This work done is stored as the potential

of two opposite charges each of magnitude
1µC separated by 2 cm. The dipole is placed
in an external electric field of 105 N C-1.
Find:
(i) The maximum torque exerted by the
field on the dipole
(ii) The work the external agent will have
to do in turning the dipole through 180°

(ii) W = pE ( cos θ1 − cos θ 2  )

In insulators, the electrons are tightly
bound to the nucleus and are thus not available
for conductivity and hence are poor conductors
of electricity. There are no free charges since
all the charges are bound to the nucleus. An
insulating material can be considered as a
collection of molecules that are not easily
ionized. An insulator can carry any distribution
of external electric charges on its surface or in
its interior and the electric field in the interior
can have non zero values unlike conductors.
8.8 Dielectrics and Electric Polarisation:
Dielectrics are insulates which can be
used to store electrical energy. This is because
when such substances are placed in an external
field, their positive and negative charges
get displaced in opposite directions and the
molecules develop a net dipole moment. This
is called polarization of the material and such
materials are called dielectrics.
In every atom there is a positively
charged nucleus and there are negatively
charged electrons surrounding it. The negative
charges form an electron cloud around the
positive charge. These two oppositely charged
regions have their own centres of charge
(where the effective charge is located). The
centre of negative charge is the centre of
mass of negatively charged electrons and that
of positive charge is the centre of mass of
positively charged protons in the nucleus.
Thus, dielectrics are insulating materials
or non- conducting substances which can be
polarised through small localised displacement
of charges. e.g. glass, wax, water, wood , mica,
rubber, stone, plastic etc.
Dielectrics can be classified as polar
dielectrics and non polar dielectrics as
described below.
Polar dielectrics:
A molecule in which the centre of mass
of positive charges (protons) does not coincide
with the centre of mass of negative charges
(electrons), because of the asymmetric shape
of the molecules is called polar molecule as
shown in Fig. 8.18 (a). They have permanent

Electrostatic shielding :
• To protect a delicate instrument from
the disturbing effects of other charged
bodies near it, place the instrument
inside a hollow conductor where E = 0.
This is called electrostatic shielding.
• Thin metal foils are used in making the
shields.
• During lightning and thunder storm it is
always advisable to stay inside the car
than near a tree in open ground, since
the car acts as a shield.
Faraday Cages:
• It is an enclosure which is used to block
the external electric fields in conductive
materials.
• Electro-magnetic
shielding:
MRI
scanning rooms are built in such a
manner that they prevent the mixing
of the external radio frequency signals
with the MRI machine.
b) Free charges and Bound charges inside
materials:
The electrical behaviour of conductors
and insulators can be understood on the basis
of free and bound charges.
In metallic conductors, the electrons in
the outermost shells of the atoms are loosely
bound to the nucleus and hence can easily get
detached and move freely inside the metal.
When an external electric field is applied, they
drift in a direction opposite to the direction of
the applied electric field. These charges are
called free charges.
The nucleus, which consist of the positive
ions and the electrons of the inner shells,
remain held in their fixed positions. These
immobile charges are called bound charges.
In electrolytic conductors, positive and
negative ions act as charge carriers but their
movements are restricted by the electrostatic
force between them and the external electric
field.
200

dipole moments of the order of 10-30 Cm. They
act as tiny electric dipoles, as the charges are
separated by a small distance. The dielectrics
like HCℓ, water, alcohol, NH3 etc are made of
polar molecules and are called polar dielectrics.
Water molecule has a bent shape with its two
O - H bonds which are inclined at an angle of
about 105°. It has a very high dipole moment
of 6.1 × 10-30 Cm. Fig. 8.18 (b) and (c) show
the structure of HCl and H2O, respectively.

Polarization of a non-polar dielectric in an
external electric field:
In the presence of an external electric
field Eo, the centres of the positive charge
in each molecule of a non-polar dielectric is
pulled in the direction of Eo, while the centres
of the negative charges are displaced in the
opposite direction. Therefore, the two centres
are separated and the molecule gets distorted.
The displacement of the charges stops when
the force exerted on them by the external field
is balanced by the restoring force between the
charges in the molecule.
Each molecule becomes a tiny dipole
having a dipole moment. The induced dipole
moments of different molecules add up giving
a net dipole moment to the dielectric in the
presence of the external field.

(b)

Fig. 8.18. Examples of Polar molecules
(b) HCI (c) H2O.

Non Polar dielectrics:
A molecule in which the centre of mass of
the positive charges coincides with the centre
of mass of the negative charges is called a non
polar molecule as shown in Fig. 8.19 (a). These
have symmetrical shapes and have zero dipole
moment in the normal state. The dielectrics
like hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, benzene,
methane are made up of nonpolar molecules
and are called non polar dielectrics. Structures
of H2 and CO2 are shown in Fig. 8.19 (b) and
(c), respectively.

Fig. 8.20 (a) Shows the non polar dielectric in
absence of electric field while.

Fig. 8.20 (b) shows it in presence of an
external field.

(b)

Polarization of a polar dielectric in an
external electric field:
The molecules of a polar dielectric have
tiny permanent dipole moments. Due to thermal
agitation in the material in the absence of any
external electric field, these dipole moments
are randomly oriented as shown in Fig. 8.21

Reduction of electric field due to polarization
of a dielectric:
When a dielectric is placed in an external
electric field, the value of the field inside the
dielectric is less than the external field as a
result of polarization. Consider a rectangular
dielectric
 slab placed in a uniform electric
field E acting parallel to two of its faces.
Since the electric charges are not free to move
about in a dielectric, no current results when it
is placed in an electric field. Instead of moving
the charges, the electric field produces a slight
rearrangement of charges within the atoms,
resulting in aligning them with the field. This
is shown in Fig. 8.20 and Fig. 8.21. During the
process of alignment charges move only over
distances that are less than an atomic diameter.
As a result of the alignment of the dipole
moments there is an apparent sheet of positive
charges on the right side and negative charges
on the left side of the dielectric. These two
sheets of induced
 surface charges produce an
electric field E0 called the polarization field
in the insulator
 which opposes the applied
electric field E . The net field E ' , inside the
dielectric
is the vector sum of the
 applied field

E and the polarization field E0
∴ E' = E - E0 (in magnitude)
This is shown in Fig. 8.22 (a), (b) and (c).

(a). Hence the total dipole moment is zero.
When an external electric field is applied the
dipole moments of different molecules tend to
align with the field. As a result the dielectric
develops a net dipole moment in the direction
of the external field. Hence the dielectric is
polarized. The extent of polarization depends
on the relative values of the two opposing
energies.

Fig. 8.21 (a) Shows the polar dielectric in
absence of electric field while.

Fig. 8.21 (b) shows it in presence of an
external field.

1. The applied external electric field which
tends to align the dipole with the field.
2. Thermal energy tending to randomise the
alignment of the dipole.
The polarization in presence of a strong
external electric field is shown in Fig. 8.21 (b)
Thus, both polar and nonpolar dielectric
develop net dipole moment in the presence of
an electric field.
The dipole moment per unit volume
 is
called polarization and is denoted
by

 P . For
linear isotropic dielectrics P = χ e E .
χ e is a constant called electric
susceptibility of the dielectric medium.
It describes the electrical behaviour of a
dielectric. It has different values for different
dielectrics.
For vacuum χe = 0.

electrical component which allows current to
pass through it and dissipates heat but can’t
store electrical energy. So there was a need
to develop a device that can store electrical
energy. The most common arrangement for
this consists of a set of conductors (conducting
plates) having charges on them and separated
by a dielectric material.
The conductors 1 and 2 shown in the Fig.
8.23 have charges +Q and -Q with potential
difference, V = V1 - V2 between them. The
electric field in the region between them is
proportional to the charge Q.




Fig. 8.22 (c) The net field E′ is a vector sum of


E and E0 .

Do you know?
If we apply a large enough electric field, we
can ionize the atoms and create a condition
for electric charge to flow like a conductor.
The fields required for the breakdown of
dielectric is called dielectric strength.
The greater the applied field, greater is the
degree of alignment of the dipoles and hence
greater is the polarization field.
The induced dipole moment disappears
when the field is removed. The induced dipole
moment is often responsible for the attraction
of a charged object towards an uncharged
insulator such as charged comb and bits of
paper.

Fig. 8.23: A capacitor formed by two conductors.

The potential difference V is the work
done to carry a unit positive test charge from
the conductor 2 to conductor 1 against the field.
As this work done will be proportional to Q,

then V ∝ Q and the ratio Q is a constant.
V
Q
∴ C =

The constant C is called the capacitance
of the capacitor, which depends on the size,
shape and separation of the system of two
conductors.
The SI unit of capacitance is farad (F).
Dimensional formula is [M-1 L-2T4A2].
1 farad = 1 coulomb/1volt
A capacitor has a capacitance of one
farad, if the potential difference across it rises
by 1volt when 1 coulomb of charge is given
to it. In practice farad is a big unit, the most
commonly used units are its submultiples.

Capacitors
and
Capacitance,
Combination of Capacitors in Series and
Parallel:
In XIth Std. you have studied about resistors,
resistance and conductance. A resistor is an
203

based on the shape of the conductors.
Combination of Capacitors:
When there is a combination of capacitors
to be used in a circuit we can sometimes
replace it with an equivalent capacitor or a
single capacitor that has the same capacitance
as the actual combination of capacitors. The
effective capacitance depends on the way the
individual capacitors are combined. Here we
discuss two basic combinations of capacitors
which can be replaced by a single equivalent
capacitor.
(a) Capacitors in series:
When a potential difference (V ) is
applied
across
several
capacitors
connected end to end in such a way that
sum of the potential difference across all the
capacitors is equal to the applied potential
difference V, then the capacitors are said to be
connected in series.

Uses of Capacitors
Principle of a capacitor:
To understand the principle of a capacitor
let us consider a metal plate P1 having area A.
Let some positive charge +Q be given to this
plate. Let its potential be V. Its capacity is
Q
given by C1 =
V
Now consider another insulated metal
plate P2 held near the plate P1. By induction a
negative charge is produced on the nearer face
and an equal positive charge develops on the
farther face of P2 (Fig. 8.24 (a)). The induced
negative charge lowers the potential of plate
P1, while the induced positive charge raises its
potential.

(a)

(b)

Fig. 8.24: (a) and (b) Parallel plate capacitor.

As the induced negative charge is closer
to P1 it is more effective, and thus there is a
net reduction in potential of plate P1. If the
outer surface of P2 is connected to earth, the
induced positive charges on P2 being free,
flows to earth. The induced negative charge on
P2 stays on it, as it is bound to positive charge
of P1. This greatly reduces the potential of P2,
(Fig 8.24 (b)). If V1 is the potential on plate P2
due to charge (- Q) then the net potential of the
system will now be +V-V1.
Q
∴C2 > C1
Hence the capacity C2 =
V - V1
Thus capacity of metal plate P1, is
increased by placing an identical earth
connected metal plate P2 near it.
Such an arrangement is called capacitor.
It is symbolically shown as
.
If the conductors are plane then it is
called parallel plate capacitor. We also have
spherical capacitor, cylindrical capacitor etc.

In series arrangement as shown in Fig.
8.25, the second plate of first conductor is
connected to the first plate of the second
conductor and so on. The last plate is connected
to earth. In a series combination, charges on
the plates (± Q)are the same on each capacitor.
Potential difference across the series
combination of capacitor is V volt,
where V = V1 + V2 + V3

This argument can be extended to yield
an equivalent capacitance for n capacitors
connected in series which is equal to the sum
of the reciprocals of individual capacitances
of the capacitors.

In this combination all the capacitors
have the same potential difference but the
plate charges (± Q1) on capacitor1, (± Q2)
on the capacitor 2 and (± Q3) on capacitor 3
are not necessarily the same. If charge Q is
applied at point A then it will be distributed to
the capacitors depending on the capacitances.
∴Total charge Q can be written as Q = Q1 +
Q2 + Q3 = C1 V + C2 V + C3V
Let Cp be the equivalent capacitance of
the combination then Q = CpV

∴C pV = C1V + C2 V + C3 V
∴ Cp = C1 + C2 + C3
The general formula for effective
capacitance Cp for parallel combination of n
capacitors follows similarly
Cp = C1 + C2+ .............. + Cn

Remember this

Capacitors are combined in parallel when
we require a large capacitance at small
potentials.

Series combination is used when a
high voltage is to be divided on several
capacitors. Capacitor with minimum
capacitance has the maximum potential
difference between the plates.
b) Capacitors in Parallel:
The parallel arrangement of capacitors
is as shown in Fig. 8.27 below, where the
insulated plates are connected to a common
terminal A which is joined to the source of
potential, while the other plates are connected
to another common terminal B which is
earthed.

transferred from one conductor to another, a
potential difference of 10 V appears between
the conductors. Find the capacitance of the
two conductors.
Solution : Given :

A parallel plate capacitor consists of two
thin conducting plates each of area A, held
parallel to each other, at a suitable distance d
apart. The plates are separated by an insulating
medium like paper, air, mica, glass etc. One of
the plates is insulated and the other is earthed

its farther face. But as this face is earthed the

In section 8.8 we have studied the
behaviour of dielectrics in an external field. Let
us now see how the capacitance of a parallel
plate capacitor is modified when a dielectric is
introduced between its plates.

8.11 Displacement Current:

C=

Fig. 8.31: Displacement current in the space
between the plates of the capacitor.

We know that electric current in a DC
circuit constitutes a flow of free electrons. In
a circuit as shown in Fig 8.31, a parallel plate
capacitor with a dielectric is connected across a
DC source. In the conducting part of the circuit
free electrons are responsible for the flow of
current. But in the region between the plates
of the capacitor, there are no free electrons
available for conduction in the dielectric.
As the circuit is closed, the current flows
through the circuit and grows to its maximum
value (ic) in a finite time (time constant of the
circuit). The conduction current, ic is found
to be same everywhere in the circuit except
inside the capacitor. As the current passes
through the leads of the capacitor, the electric
field between the plates increases and this in
turn causes polarisation of the dielectric. Thus,
there is a current in the dielectric due to the
movement of the bound charges. The current
due to bound charges is called displacement
current (id) or charge- separation current.
We can now derive an expression between
ic and id.
From Eq (8.23) we can infer that the
charge produced on the plates of a capacitor is
due to the electric field E.

Differentiating the above equation, we get

The rate of change of electric field (dE/dt)
across the capacitor is directly proportional to
the current (ic) flowing in the conducting part
of the circuit.
The quantity on the RHS of Eq (8.24) is
having the dimension of electric current and is
caused by the displacement of bound charges
in the dielectric of the capacitor under the
influence of the electric field. This current,
called displacement current (id), is equivalent
to the rate of flow of charge (dq/dt=ic) in
the conducting part of the circuit. In the
absence of any dielectric between the plates
of the capacitor, k =1 (for air or vacuum), the
displacement current id = Aε0 (dE/dt).
As a broad generalization of displacement
current in a circuit containing a capacitor, it
can be stated that the displacement currents do
not remain confined to the space between the
plates of a capacitor. A displacement current
(id) exists at any point in space where, timevarying electric field (E) exists (i.e. dE/dt ≠0).

8.12 Energy Stored in a Capacitor:
A capacitor is a device used to store energy.
Charging a capacitor means transferring
electron from one plate of the capacitor to the
other. Hence work will have to be done by the
battery in order to remove the electrons against
the opposing forces. These opposing forces
arise since the electrons are being pushed to
the negative plate which repels them and
electrons are removed from the positive plate
which tends to attract them. In both the cases,
the forces oppose the transfer from one plate to
another. As the charges on the plate increases,
opposition also increases.
This work done is stored in the form of
electrostatic energy in the electric field between
the plates, which can later be recovered by
discharging the capacitor.

Example 8.17 A parallel plate capacitor
has an area of 4 cm2 and a plate separation
of 2 mm
(i) Calculate its capacitance
(ii) What is its capacitance if the space
between the plates is filled completely with
a dielectric having dielectric constant of

8.13 Van de Graaff Generator:
Van de Graaff generator is a device used
to develop very high potentials of the order of
107 volts. The resulting large electric fields are
used to accelerate charged particles (electrons,
protons, ions) to high energies needed for
experiments to probe the small scale structure
of matter and for various experiments in
Nuclear Physics.
It was designed by Van de Graaff (19011967) in the year 1931.
Principle: This generator is based on
(i) the phenomenon of Corona Discharge
(action of sharp points),
(ii) the property that charge given to a hollow
conductor is transferred to its outer surface
and is distributed uniformly over it,
(iii) if a charge is continuously supplied to an
insulated metallic conductor, the potential
of the conductor goes on increasing.

Observe and discuss
The energy supplied to the battery is QV
but energy stored in the electric field is
1
1
QV. The rest half QV of energy is
2
2
wasted as heat in the connecting wires and
battery itself.
Example 8.19: A parallel plate air capacitor
has a capacitance of 3 × 10–9 Farad. A slab
of dielectric constant 3 and thickness 3 cm
completely fills the space between the plates.
210

Construction:
Fig. 8.33 shows the schematic diagram of
Van de Graaff generator.

filled with nitrogen at high pressure. A small
quantity of Freon gas is mixed with nitrogen to
ensure better insulation between the vessel S
and its contents. A metal plate M held opposite
to the brush A on the other side of the belt is
connected to the vessel S, which is earthed.
Working: The electric motor connected to the
pulley P1 is switched on, which begins to rotate
setting the conveyor belt into motion. The DC
supply is then switched on. From the pointed
ends of the spray brush A, positive charge is
continuously sprayed on the belt B. The belt
carries this charge in the upward direction,
which is collected by the collector brush C and
sent to the dome shaped conductor.
As the dome is hollow, the charge is
distributed over the outer surface of the dome.
Its potential rises to a very high value due to
the continuous accumulation of charges on it.
The potential of the electrode I also rises to
this high value.
The positive ions such as protons or
deuterons from a small vessel (not shown in
the figure) containing ionised hydrogen or
deuterium are then introduced in the upper part
of the evacuated accelerator tube. These ions,
repelled by the electrode I, are accelerated in
the downward direction due to the very high
fall of potential along the tube, these ions
acquire very high energy. These high energy
charged particles are then directed so as to
strike a desired target.
Uses: The main use of Van de Graff generator
is to produce very high energy charged particles
having energies of the order of 10 MeV. Such
high energy particles are used
1. to carry out the disintegration of nuclei of
different elements,
2. to produce radioactive isotopes,
3. to study the nuclear structure,
4. to study different types of nuclear reactions,
5. accelerating electrons to sterilize food and
to process materials.

An endless conveyor belt BB made of an
insulating material such as reinforced rubber
or silk, can move over two pulleys P1 and
P2. The belt is kept continuously moving by
a motor (not shown in the figure) driving the
lower pulley (P1).
The spray brush A, consisting of a large
number of pointed wires, is connected to the
positive terminal of a high voltage DC power
supply. From this brush positive charge can
be sprayed on the belt which can be collected
by another similar brush C. This brush is
connected to a large, dome-shaped, hollow
metallic conductor D, which is mounted on
insulating pillars (not shown in the figure). E
is an evacuated accelerating tube having an
electrode I at its upper end, connected to the
dome-shaped conductor.
To prevent the leakage of charge from
the dome, the pulley and belt arrangement,
the dome and a part of the evacuated tube
are enclosed inside a large steel vessel S,

Can you recall?

There can be three types of electrical
conductors: good conductors (metals),
semiconductors and bad conductors
(insulators).
Does a semiconductor diode and resistor
have similar electrical properties?
Can you explain why two or more
resistors connected in series and parallel
have different effective resistances?

Fig 9.1: Electric network.

For a steady current flowing through an
electrical network of resistors, the following
Kirchhoff 's laws are applicable.
9.2.1 Kirchhoff’s First Law: (Current law/
Junction law)
The algebraic sum of the currents at a
junction is zero in an electrical network, i.e.,

9.1 Introduction:
In XIth Std. we have studied the origin of
electrical conductivity, in particular for metals.
We have also studied how to calculate the
effective resistance of two or more resistances
in series and in parallel. However, a circuit
containing several complex connections
of electrical components cannot be easily
reduced into a single loop by using the rules
of series and parallel combination of resistors.
More complex circuits can be analyzed
by using Kirchhoff’s laws. Gustav Robert
Kirchhoff (1824-1887) formulated two rules
for analyzing a complicated circuit. In this
chapter we will discuss these laws and their
applications.
9.2 Kirchhoff’s Laws of Electrical Network:
Before describing these laws we will
define some terms used for electrical circuits.
Junction: Any point in an electric circuit where
two or more conductors are joined together is
a junction.
Loop: Any closed conducting path in an
electric network is called a loop or mesh.
Branch: A branch is any part of the network
that lies between two junctions.
In Fig. 9.1, there are two junctions,
labeled a and b. There are three branches:
these are the three possible paths 1, 2 and 3
from a to b.

Fig. 9.2: Kirchhoff first law.

Sign convention:
The currents arriving at the junction are
considered positive and the currents leaving
the junction are considered negative.
Consider a junction P in a circuit where
six conductors meet (Fig.9.2). Applying the
sign convention, we can write
I1 - I2 + I3 +I4 -I5 -I6 = 0 --- (9.1)
Arriving currents I1, I3 and I4 are considered
positive and leaving currents I2, I5 and I6 are
considered negative.
Equation (9.1) can also be written as
I1 + I3 + I4 = I2 +I5 + I6
Thus the total current flowing towards the
junction is equal to the total current flowing
away from the junction.

(9.2), we get,
-I1R1-I3R5-I1R3+ε1= 0
∴ε1= I1R1+ I3R5+ I1R3
Now consider the loop BFDCB in

Remember this
Kirchhoff’s first law is consistent with
the conservation of electrical charge while
the voltage law is consistent with the law of
conservation of energy.
Some charge is received per unit time
due to the currents arriving at a junction. For
conservation of charge, same amount of charge
must leave the junction per unit time which
leads to the law of currents.
Algebraic sum of emfs (energy per unit
charge) corresponds to the electrical energy
supplied by the source. According to the law of
conservation of energy, this energy must appear
in the form of electrical potential difference
across the electrical elements/devices in the
loop. This leads to the law of voltages.

9.2.2 Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law:
The algebraic sum of the potential
differences (products of current and resistance)
and the electromotive forces (emfs) in a closed
loop is zero.

 IR     0
Sign convention:
1. While tracing a loop through a resistor,
if we are travelling along the direction
of conventional current, the potential
difference across that resistance is
considered negative. If the loop is traced
against the direction of the conventional
current, the potential difference across that
resistor is considered positive.
2. The emf of an electrical source is positive
while tracing the loop within the source
from the negative terminal of the source to
its positive terminal. It is taken as negative
while tracing within the source from
positive terminal to the negative terminal.

Steps usually followed while solving a
problem using Kirchhoff’s laws:
i) Choose some direction of the currents.
ii) Reduce the number of variables using
Kirchhoff’s first law.
iii) Determine the number of independent
loops.
iv) Apply voltage law to all the independent
loops.
v) Solve
the
equations
obtained
simultaneously.
vi) In case, the answer of a current variable
is negative, the conventional current is
flowing in the direction opposite to that
chosen by us.

9.3 Wheatstone Bridge:
Resistance of a material changes due to
several factors such as temperature, strain,
humidity, displacement, liquid level, etc.
Therefore, measurement of these properties
is possible by measuring the resistance.
Measurable values of resistance vary from
a few milliohms to hundreds of mega ohms.
Depending upon the resistance range (milliohm
to tens of ohm, tens of ohm to hundreds of ohms,
hundreds of ohm to mega ohm, etc.), various
methods are used for resistance measurement.
Wheatstone’s bridge is generally used to
measure resistances in the range from tens of
ohm to hundreds of ohms.

Example 9.3: For the given network, find
the current through 4 ohm and 3 ohm.
Assume that the cells have negligible
internal resistance.

A special case occurs when the current
passing through the galvanometer is zero. In
this case, the bridge is said to be balanced.
Condition for the balance is Ig = 0. This
condition can be obtained by adjusting the
values of P, Q, R and S. Substituting Ig = 0 in
Eq. (9.4) and Eq. (9.5) we get,
– I1P + I2S = 0 ∴ I1P = I2S
--- (9.6)
– I1Q + I2R = 0 ∴ I1Q = I2R
--- (9.7)
Dividing Eq. (9.6) by Eq. (9.7), we get
P S 			
=
--- (9.8)
Q R

The Wheatstone Bridge was originally
developed by Charles Wheatstone (1802- 1875)
to measure the values of unknown resistances.
It is also used for calibrating measuring
instruments, voltmeters, ammeters, etc.
Four resistances P, Q, R and S are
connected to form a quadrilateral ABCD as
shown in the Fig. 9.4. A battery of emf ε along
with a key is connected between the points A
and C such that point A is at higher potential
with respect to the point C. A galvanometer
of internal resistance G is connected between
points B and D.
When the key is closed, current I flows
through the circuit. It divides into I1 and I2 at
point A. I1 is the current through P and I2 is the
current through S. The current I1 gets divided at
point B. Let Ig be the current flowing through
the galvanometer. The currents flowing
through Q and R are respectively (I1 – Ig) and
(I1 + Ig),
From the Fig. 9.4,		
I = I1 + I2
--- (9.3)
Consider the loop ABDA. Applying
Kirchhoff’s voltage law in the clockwise sense
shown in the loop we get,
– I1P – IgG + I2S = 0
--- (9.4)
Now consider loop BCDB, applying
Kirchhoff’s voltage law in the clockwise sense
shown in the loop we get,
– (I1 – Ig) Q + (I2 + Ig) R + Ig G = 0 --- (9.5)

This is the condition for balancing the
Wheatstone bridge.
If any three resistances in the bridge are
known, the fourth resistance can be determined
by using Eq. (9.8).
Example 9.4: At what value should the
variable resistor be set such that the bridge
is balanced? If the source voltage is 30 V
find the value of the output voltage across
XY, when the bridge is balanced.

Temporary contact with the wire AB can be
established with the help of the jockey. A cell
of emf ε along with a key and a rheostat are
connected between the points A and B.
A suitable resistance R is selected from
resistance box. The jockey is brought in contact
with AB at various points on the wire AB and
the balance point (null point), D, is obtained.
The galvanometer shows no deflection when
the jockey is at the balance point.
Let the respective lengths of the wire

be  x and  R . Then using the conditions for

Application of Wheatstone bridge:
Figure 9.4 is a basic circuit diagram of
Wheatstone bridge, however, in practice
the circuit is used in different manner. In all
cases it is used to determine some unknown
resistance. Few applications of Wheatstone
bridge circuits are discussed in the following
article.
9.3.1 Metre Bridge:

Fig. 9.5: Metre bridge.

Example 9.5: Two resistances 2 ohm and 3
ohm are connected across the two gaps of the
metre bridge as shown in figure. Calculate
the current through the cell when the bridge
is balanced and the specific resistance of the
material of the metre bridge wire. Given the
resistance of the bridge wire is 1.49 ohm and
its diameter is 0.12 cm.
Solution: When the bridge is balanced, the
resistances 2 and 3 ohm are in series and the
total resistance is 5 ohm.
Let R1 be the resistance of the wire =1.49
Ω, and R2 be the total resistance (2+3)=5 Ω

Metre bridge (Fig. 9.5) consists of a
wire of uniform cross section and one metre
in length, stretched on a metre scale which is
fixed on a wooden table. The ends of the wire
are fixed below two L shaped metallic strips.
A single metallic strip separates the two L
shaped strips leaving two gaps, left gap and
right gap. Usually, an unknown resistance X is
connected in the left gap and a resistance box
is connected in the other gap. One terminal of
a galvanometer is connected to the terminal C
on the central strip, while the other terminal
of the galvanometer carries the jockey (J).

Observe and discuss
1. Kelvin’s method to determine the
resistance of galvanometer (G) by using
meter bridge.

Remember this
Source of errors.
1. The cross section of the wire may not
be uniform.
2. The ends of the wire are soldered to the
metallic strip where contact resistance
is developed, which is not taken into
account.
3. The measurements of  x and  R may
not be accurate.
To minimize the errors
(i) The value of R is so adjusted that the
null point is obtained to middle one
third of the wire (between 34 cm and
66 cm) so that percentage error in
the measurement of  x and  R are
minimum and nearly the same.
(ii) The experiment is repeated by
interchanging the positions of unknown
resistance X and known resistance box
R.
(iii) The jockey should be tapped on the
wire and not slided. We use jockey to

The galvanometer whose resistance (G) is
to be determined is connected in one gap
and a known resistance (R) in the other gap.
Working :
1. 	 A suitable resistance is taken in the
resistance box. The current is sent
round the circuit by closing the key.
Without touching the jockey at any
point of the wire, the deflection in the
galvanometer is observed.
2. The rheostat is adjusted to get a suitable
deflection Around (2/3)rd of range.
3. 	 Now, the jockey is tapped at different
points of the wire and a point of contact
D for which, the galvanometer shows
no change in the deflection, is found.
4. 	 As the galvanometer shows the same
deflection with or without contact
219

between the point B and D, these two
points must be equipotential points.
5. 	 The length of the bridge wire between
the point D and the left end of the
wire is measured. Let lg be the length
of the segment of wire opposite to the
galvanometer and lr be the length of
the segment opposite to the resistance
box.

The resistances in the arms P and Q

Strain
Measurement:
Strain gauges are commonly used
for measuring the strain. Their electrical
resistance is proportional to the strain in
the device. In practice, the range of strain
gauge resistance is from 30 ohms to 3000
ohms. For a given strain, the resistance
change may be only a fraction of full range.
Therefore, to measure small resistance
changes with high accuracy, Wheatstone
bridge configuration is used. The figure
below shows the Wheatstone bridge where
the unknown resistor is replaced with a
strain gauge as shown in the figure.

Using this formula, the unknown resistance
of the galvanometer can be calculated.
2. Post Office Box
A post office box (PO Box) is a
practical form of Wheatstone bridge as
shown in the figure.

It consists of three arms P, Q and R.
The resistances in these three arms are
adjustable. The two ratio arms P and Q
contain resistances 10 ohm, 100 ohm and
1000 ohm each. The third arm R contains
resistances from 1 ohm to 5000 ohm. The
unknown resistance X forms the fourth
resistance. There are two tap keys K1 and
K2 .

In these circuit, two resistors R1 and
R2 are equal to each other and R3 is the
variable resistor. With no force applied
to the strain gauge, rheostat is varied and

finally positioned such that the voltmeter
will indicate zero deflection, i.e., the bridge
is balanced. The strain at this condition
represents the zero of the gauge.
If the strain gauge is either stretched
or compressed, then the resistance changes.
This causes unbalancing of the bridge. This
produces a voltage indication on voltmeter
which corresponds to the strain change. If
the strain applied on a strain gauge is more,
then the voltage difference across the meter
terminals is more. If the strain is zero, then
the bridge balances and meter shows zero
reading.
This is the application of precise
resistance measurement using a Wheatstone
bridge.

Fig. 9.6: Potentiometer.

Consider a point C on the wire at distance
 from the point A, as shown in the figure.
The potential difference between A and C is
VAC. Therefore,
VAC = K  i.e. VAC ∝ 
Thus, the potential difference between two
points on the wire is directly proportional to
the length of the wire between them provided
the wire is of uniform cross section, the current
through the wire is the same and temperature
of the wire remains constant. Uses of
potentiometer are discussed below.
9.4.2 Use of Potentiometer:
A) To Compare emf. of Cells

9.4 Potentiometer:
A voltmeter is a device which is used for
measuring potential difference between two
points in a circuit. An ideal voltmeter which
does not change the potential difference to be
measured, should have infinite resistance so
that it does not draw any current. Practically,
a voltmeter cannot be designed to have an
infinite resistance. Potentiometer is one such
device which does not draw any current from
the circuit. It acts as an ideal voltmeter. It is
used for accurate measurement of potential
difference.
9.4.1 Potentiometer Principle:
A potentiometer consists of a long wire AB
of length L and resistance R having uniform
cross sectional area A. (Fig. 9.6) A cell of emf
ε having internal resistance r is connected
across AB as shown in the Fig. 9.6. When the
circuit is switched on, current I passes through
the wire.

When two cells are connected so that
their negative terminals are together or their
positive terminals are connected together as
shown in Fig. 9.8 (b).
In this case their emf oppose each other
and effective emf of the combination of two
cells is ε 1 – ε 2 ( ε 1 > ε 2 assumed). This method
of connecting two cells is called the difference
method. Remember that this combination of
cells is not a parallel combination of cells.

potential than point B. The cells whose emfs
are to be compared are connected with their
positive terminals at point A and negative
terminals to the extreme terminals of a twoway key K1K2. The central terminal of the two
ways key is connected to a galvanometer. The
other end of the galvanometer is connected to
a jockey (J). (Fig. 9.7) Key K is closed and
then, key K1 is closed and key K2 is kept open.
Therefore, the cell of emf ε1 comes into circuit.
The null point is obtained by touching the
jockey at various points on the potentiometer
wire AB. Let  1 be the length of the wire
between the null point and the point A.  1
corresponds to emf ε 1 of the cell. Therefore,
ε1 = K 1
where K is the potential gradient along the
potentiometer wire.
Now key K1 is kept open and key K2 is
closed. The cell of emf ε 2 now comes in the
circuit. Again, the null point is obtained with
the help of the Jockey. Let  2 be the length of
the wire between the null point and the point
A. This length corresponds to the emf ε 2 of
the cell.
∴ ε2 = K 2
From the above two equations we get
1 1

			--- (9.10)
2 2
Thus, we can compare the emfs of the two
cells. If any one of the emfs is known, the
other can be determined.
Method II: The emfs of cells can be compared
also by another method called sum and
difference method.
When two cells are connected so that the
positive terminal of the first cell is connected
to the negative terminal of the second cell
as shown in Fig 9.8 (a). The emf of the two
cells are added up and the effective emf of
the combination of two cells is ε 1 + ε 2 . This
method of connecting two cells is called the
sum method.

Fig. 9.8 (a):Sum method.

Fig. 9.8 (b): Difference method.

Circuit is connected as shown in Fig.9.9.
When keys K1 and K3 are closed the cells ε 1
and ε 2 are in the sum mode. The null point
is obtained using the jockey. Let  1 be the
length of the wire between the null point
and the point A. This corresponds to the emf
( ε 1 + ε 2 ).
∴ ε1 + ε 2 = k 1
Now the key K1 and K3 are kept open and
keys K2 and K4 are closed. In this case the two
cells are in the difference mode. Again the null
point is obtained. Let  2 be the length of the
wire between the null point and the point A.
This corresponds to ε 1 - ε 2
∴ ε1 - ε 2 =  2

Fig. 9.9: Emf comparison, sum and difference
method.

From the above two equations,

The length of the wire  2 between the
null point and point A is measured. This
corresponds to the voltage between the null
point and point A.

Thus, emf of two cells can be compared.
B) To Find Internal Resistance (r) of a Cell:
The experimental set up for this method
consists of a potentiometer wire AB connected
in series with a cell of emf ε , the key K1, and
rheostat as shown in Fig. 9.10. The terminal A
is at higher potential than terminal B. A cell
of emf ε1 whose internal resistance r1 is to be
determined is connected to the potentiometer
wire through a galvanometer G and the jockey
J. A resistance box R is connected across the
cell ε 1 through the key K2.

This equation gives the internal resistance of
the cell.
C) Application of potentiometer:
The applications of potentiometer
discussed above are used in laboratory. Some
practical applications of potentiometer are
given below.
1) Voltage Divider: The potentiometer can
be used as a voltage divider to continuously
change the output voltage of a voltage supply
(Fig. 9.11). As shown in the Fig. 9.11,
potential V is set up between points A and B
of a potentiometer wire. One end of a device is
connected to positive point A and the other end
is connected to a slider that can move along
wire AB. The voltage V divides in proportion
of lengths l1 and l2 as shown in the figure 9.11.

Fig. 9.10 : Internal resistance of a cell.

The key K1 is closed and K2 is open. The
circuit now consists of the cell ε , cell ε 1 , and
the potentiometer wire. The null point is then
obtained. Let  1 be length of the potentiometer
wire between the null point and the point A.
This length corresponds to emf ε 1 .
∴ ε 1 = k  1 where k is potential gradient of the
potentiometer wire which is constant.
Now both the keys K1 and K2 are closed so
that the circuit consists of the cell ε , the cell
ε 1 , the resistance box, the galvanometer and
the jockey. Some resistance R is selected from
the resistance box and null point is obtained.

Fig. 9.11 :
Potentiometer as
a voltage divider.

2) Audio Control: Sliding potentiometers, are
commonly used in modern low-power audio
systems as audio control devices. Both sliding
223

difference of the order 10–6 volt can
be measured with it. Least count of a
potentiometer is much better compared to
that of a voltmeter.
Demerits:
Potentiometer is not portable and direct
measurement of potential difference or emf is
not possible.
9.5 Galvanometer:
A galvanometer is a device used to detect
weak electric currents in a circuit. It has a
coil pivoted (or suspended) between concave
pole faces of a strong laminated horse shoe
magnet. When an electric current passes
through the coil, it deflects.   The deflection is
proportional to the current passing through the
coil. The deflection of the coil can be read with
the help of a pointer attached to it. Position
of the pointer on the scale provided indicates
the current passing through the galvanometer
or the potential difference across it. Thus, a
galvanometer can be used as an ammeter or
voltmeter with suitable modification. The
galvanometer coil has a moderate resistance
(about 100 ohms) and the galvanometer itself
has a small current carrying capacity (about
1 mA).

(faders) and rotary potentiometers (knobs)
are regularly used for frequency attenuation,
loudness control and for controlling different
characteristics of audio signals.
3) Potentiometer as a senor: If the slider of
a potentiometer is connected to the moving
part of a machine, it can work as a motion
sensor. A small displacement of the moving
part causes changes in potential which is
further amplified using an amplifier circuit.
The potential difference is calibrated in terms
of the displacement of the moving part.
Example 9.7:
In an experiment to
determine the internal resistance of a cell
of emf 1.5 V, the balance point in the open
cell condition at is 76.3 cm. When a resistor
of 9.5 ohm is used in the external circuit of
the cell the balance point shifts to 64.8 cm
of the potentiometer wire. Determine the
internal resistance of the cell.
Solution: Open cell balancing length

9.4.3 Advantages of a Potentiometer Over
a Voltmeter:
Merits:
i) Potentiometer is more sensitive than a
voltmeter.
ii) A potentiometer can be used to measure
a potential difference as well as an emf
of a cell. A voltmeter always measures
terminal potential difference, and as it
draws some current, it cannot be used to
measure an emf of a cell.
iii) Measurement of potential difference or
emf is very accurate in the case of a
potentiometer. A very small potential

9.5.1 Galvanometer as an Ammeter:
Let the full scale deflection current and
the resistance of the coil G of moving coil
galvanometer (MCG ) be Is and G. It can be
converted into an ammeter, which is a current
measuring instrument. It is always connected
in series with a resistance R through which the
current is to be measured.

To convert a moving coil galvanometer
(MCG ) into an ammeter
To convert an MCG into an ammeter, the
modifications necessary are
1. Its effective current capacity must be
increased to the desired higher value.
2. Its effective resistance must be decreased.
The finite resistance G of the galvanometer
when connected in series, decreases the
current through the resistance R which is
actually to be measured. In ideal case, an
ammeter should have zero resistance.
3. It must be protected from the possible
damages, which are likely due to the
passage of an excess electric current to be
passed.
In practice this is achieved by connecting
a low resistance in parallel with the
galvanometer, which effectively reduces
the resistance of the galvanometer. This low
resistance connected in parallel is called shunt
(S). This arrangement is shown in Fig. 9.13.
Uses of the shunt:
a. It is used to divert a large part of total
current by providing an alternate path
and thus it protects the instrument from
damage.
b. It increases the range of an ammeter.
c. It decreases the resistance between the
points to which it is connected.
The shunt resistance is calculated as
follows. In the arrangement shown in the figure,
Ig is the current through the galvanometer.
Therefore, the current through S is
(I – Ig) = Is

This is the required shunt to increase the range
n times.
(ii) Also if Is is the current through the shunt
resistance, then the remaining current (I – Is)
will flow through galvanometer. Hence

resistance of 100 Ω and its full scale
deflection current is 100 µ A. What shunt
resistance should be added so that the
ammeter can have a range of 0 to 10 mA ?
Solution: Given IG = 100 µ A = 0.1 mA
The upper limit gives the maximum current
to be measured, which is I = 10 mA .

9.5.2 Galvanometer as a Voltmeter:
A voltmeter is an instrument used to
measure potential difference between two
points in an electrical circuit. It is always
connected in parallel with the component
across which voltage drop is to be measured.
A galvanometer can be used for this purpose.
To Convert a Moving Coil Galvanometer
into a Voltmeter.
To convert an MCG into a Voltmeter the
modifications necessary are:
1. Its voltage measuring capacity must be
increased to the desired higher value.
2. Its effective resistance must be increased,
and
3. It must be protected from the possible
damages, which are likely due to excess
applied potential difference.
All these requirements can be fulfilled, if
we connect a resistance of suitable high value
(X) in series with the given MCG.
A voltmeter is connected across the points
where potential difference is to be measured. If
a galvanometer is used to measure voltage, it
draws some current (due to its low resistance),
therefore, actual potential difference to be
measured decreases. To avoid this, a voltmeter
should have very high resistance. Ideally, it
should have infinite resistance.

galvanometer.

Do you know?

You can show that wires having
currents passing through them, (a) in
opposite directions repel and (b) in the
same direction attract.
Hang two conducting wires from
an insulating support. Connect them to
a cell first as shown in Fig. 10.1 (a) and
later as shown Fig. 10.1 (b), with the help
of binding posts. You will notice that the
wires in (a) repel each other and those in (b)
come closer, i.e., they attract each other as
soon as the current starts. The force in this
experiment is certainly not of electrostatic
origin, even through the current is due to the
electrons flowing in the wires. The overall
charge neutrality is maintained throughout
the wire, hence the electrostatic forces are
ruled out.

You must have noticed high tension power
transmission lines, the power lines on the
big tall steel towers. Strong magnetic fields
are created by these lines. Care has to be
taken to reduce the exposure levels to less
than 0.5 milligauss (mG).
10.1 Introduction:
In this Chapter you will be studying how
magnetic fields are produced by an electric
current. Important foundation for further
developments will also be laid down.
Hans Christian Oersted first discovered
that magnetic field is produced by an electric
current passing through a wire. Later, Gauss,
Henry, Faraday and others showed that
magnetic field is an important partner of
electric field. Maxwell’s theoretical work
highlighted the close relationship of electric
and magnetic fields. This resulted into several
practical applications in day today life,
for example electrical motors, generators,
communication systems and computers.
In electrostatics, we have considered
static charges and the force exerted by them on
other charge or test charge. We now consider
forces between charges in motion.

You have learnt in Xth Std. that if a
magnetic needle is held in close proximity of
a current carrying wire, it shows the direction
of magnetic field circling around the wire.
Imagine that a current carrying wire is grabbed
with your right hand with the thumb pointing
in the direction of the current, then your fingers
curl around in the direction of the magnetic
field (Fig. 10.2).


(ii) If the charge
 is stationary, v =0, the

I

hand thumb rule.

force = 0, even if B ≠ 0.
From Eq. (10.4) it may be observed that
the force on the charge due to electric field
depends on the strength of the electric field
and the magnitude of the charge. However, the
magnetic force depends on the velocity of the
charge and the cross product of the
 velocity
vector v the magnetic field vector B , and the
charge q.


Consider the vectors v and
 Bwith certain
angle between them. Then v × B will be a
vector perpendicular

 to the plane containing
the vectors v and B (Fig. 10.4).

Fig. 10.3: Force on wire
2 due to current in wire 1.

How can one account for the force on
the neighbouring current carrying wire? The
magnetic field due to current in the wire 1 at
any point on wire 2 is directed into the plane
of the paper. The electrons flow in a direction
opposite to the conventional current. Then the
wire 2 experiences a force F towards wire 1.
10.2 Magnetic Force:
From the above discussion and Fig. 10.3,
you
 must have
 realized that the directions of
v , B and F follow a vector cross product
relationship. Actually the magnetic force Fm

--- (10.4)
Justification for this law can be found in
experiments such as the one described in Fig.
10.1 (a) and (b). The force described in Fig.
F e is
(10.4) is known as Lorentz force. Here

the force due to electric field and F m is the
force due to magnetic field.
There are interesting consequences of the
Lorentz force law. 
(i) If the velocity v of a charged
particle is

parallel to the magnetic field B , the magnetic
force is zero.

Fig. 10.4: The cross product is in the direction

of
the unit vector perpendicular to both v and B .



Thus the vectors v and F are always

perpendicular to each other.
 Hence. F . v =0,
for any magnetic field B . Magnetic force F m
is thus perpendicular to the displacement and
hence the magnetic force never does any work
on moving charges.
The magnetic forces may change the
direction of motion of a charged particle but
they can never affect the speed.
Interestingly, Eq.
 (10.2) leads to the
definition
of
units
of
  B . From Eq. (10.2),

F = q | v × B | = qvB sin θ , --- (10.5)
where θ is the angle between v and B
and is unit vector in the direction of force .
If the force F is 1 N acting on the
-1
charge of 1 C moving

perpendicular to B , then we can define the
unit of B.

10.3 Cyclotron Motion:
In a magnetic field, a charged particle
typically undergoes circular motion. Figure

perpendicularly into the plane of the paper
(parallel to the -ve z axis).

This SI unit is called tesla (T)
1 T = 104 gauss. Gauss is not an SI unit,
but is used as a convenient unit.

Figure 10.5 shows a particle with charge
q moving with a speed v, and a uniform
magnetic field B is directed into the plane

law, the magnetic force on the particle will
act towards the centre of a circle of radius R,

sustain a uniform circular motion.

accelerator, the cyclotron.

Do you know?
Let us look at a charged particle which
is moving in a circle with a constant speed.
This is uniform circular motion that you
have studied earlier. Thus, there must be
a net force acting on the particle, directed
towards the centre of the circle. As the speed
is constant, the force also must be constant,
always perpendicular to the velocity of the
particle at any given instant of time. Such a
force is
 provided by the uniform magnetic
field B perpendicular to the plane of the
circle along which the charged particle
moves.

accelerates due to the potential difference
between the two Ds and again performs
semicircular motion in the other D. Thus the
ion is acted upon by the electric field every
time it moves from one D to the other D. As the
electric field is alternating, its sign is changed
in accordance with the circular motion of the
ion. Hence the ion is always accelerated, its
energy increases and the radius of its circular
path also increases, making the entire path a
spiral (See Fig. 10.6).

10.3.1 Cyclotron Accelerator:
Particle accelerators have played a key
role in providing high energy (MeV to GeV)
particle beams useful in studying particlematter interactions and some of these are also
useful in medical treatment of certain tumors/
diseases.
The Cyclotron is a charged particle
accelerator, accelerating charged particles to
high energies. It was invented by Lawrence
and Livingston in the year 1934 for the purpose
of studying nuclear structure.
Both electric as well as magnetic fields
are used in a Cyclotron, in combination. These
are applied in directions perpendicular to each
other and hence they are called crossed fields.
The magnetic field puts the particle (ion) into
circular path and a high frequency electric
field accelerates it. Frequency of revolution
of a charged particle is independent of its
energy, in a magnetic field. This fact is used
in this machine. Cyclotron consists of two
semicircular disc-like metal chambers, D1 and
D2, called the dees (Ds). Figure 10.6 shows a
schematic diagram of a cyclotron. A uniform
magnetic field B is applied perpendicular
to plane of the Ds. This magnetic field is
produced using an electromagnet producing a
field upto 1.5 T. An alternating voltage upto
10000 V at high frequency, 10 MHz (fa), is
applied between the two Ds. Positive ions are
produced by a gas ionizing source kept at the
point O in between the two Ds. The electric
field provides acceleration to the charged
particle (ion).
Once the ion in emitted, it accelerates due
to the negative voltage of a D and performs a
semi circular motion within the D. Whenever
the ion moves from one D to the other D, it

with the two Ds. A uniform magnetic field B is
perpendicular to the plane of the paper, coming
out. The ions are injected into the D at point P.
An alternating voltage is supplied to the Ds. The
entire assembly is placed in a vacuum chamber.

Consider an ion source placed at P. An
ion moves in a semi circular path in one of the
Ds and reaches the gap between the two Ds
in a time interval T/2, T being the period of
a full revolution. Using the Cyclotron formula
Eq. (10.7),
mv = qBR,
where q is the change on the ion.

The frequency of the applied voltage (fa)
between the two Ds is adjusted so that polarity
of the two Ds is reversed as the ion arrives at
the gap after completing one semi circle. This
condition fa = fc is the resonance condition.
The ions do not experience any electric
field while they travel within the D. Their
kinetic energy increases by eV every time they
cross over from one D to the other. Here V is
the voltage difference across the gap. The ions
move in circular path with successively larger
and larger radius to a maximum radius at
which they are deflected by a magnetic field so
that they can be extracted through an exit slit.
From Eq. (10.7),
qBRexit ,
v=

where Rexit is the radius of the path at the
exit.

Thus the final energy is proportional to the
square of the radius of the outermost circular
path (Rexit).
10.4 Helical Motion:
So far it has been assumed that the charged
particle moves in
 a plane perpendicular to
magnetic field B . If such a particle has

B,
some
component
of
velocity
parallel
to

( v / / ) then itleads to helical 
motion. Since a
v / / is parallel to B , the magnetic
component

force F m will be:
z

Thus, v / / will not be affected and the

particle will move along the direction of B .
At the same time the perpendicular component
of the velocity ( v ⊥) leads to circular motion
as stated above. As aresult, the particle moves
parallel to the field B while moving
along a

circular path perpendicular to B . Thus the
path becomes a helix (Fig. 10.7).

There have been several accelerators
in India since 1953. The Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE), Govt. of India, had
taken initiative in setting up accelerators
for research. Apart from ion accelerators,
the DAE has developed and commissioned
a 2 GeV electron accelerator which is a
radiation source for research in science. This
accelerator, 'Synchrotron', is fully functional

Solution: The current I in the loop with

Fm = IBa,
where a is the length of one arm of the

This force is balanced by the force due

10.7 Torque on a Current Loop:
It will be very interesting to apply the
results of the above sections to a current
carrying loop of a wire. You have learnt about
an electric motor in Xth Std. An electric motor
works on the principle you have studied in the
preceding sections, i.e., the magnetic force on
a current carrying wire due to a magnetic field.
Figure 10.10 shows a current carrying loop
(abcd) in a uniform magnetic field.There will,
therefore, be the magnetic forces F m acting in
opposite directions on the segments of the loop
ab and cd. This results into rotation of the loop
about its central axis.
Without going into the details of contact
carbon brushes and external circuit, we can
visualize the rotating action of a motor.

Fig. 10.12 (b): Side view of the loop abcd at an
angle θ.

The current carrying wire loop is of
rectangular shape and is placed in the uniform
magnetic field in such a way that the segments
ab and cd of the loop are perpendicular to the
field B . We can use the right hand rule (Fig.
10.11) to find out the direction of the magnetic

force F m . Let the pointing finger of the right
hand show the direction of the current, let
the middle finger show the direction of the

magnetic field B , then the stretched thumb
shows the direction of the force.
Let us now look at the action of rotation
in detail. For this purpose, consider Fig. 10.12
a, showing the rectangular loop abcd placed in

a uniform magnetic field B such that the sides
ab and
 cd are perpendicular to the magnetic
field B but the sides bc and da are not.

Now we can calculate the net force and the
net torque on the loop in a situation depicted in
Fig. 10.12 (a) and (b). Let us obtainthe forces
on all sides of the loop. The force F 4 on side
4 (bc) will be

--- (10.21)
F 4 = Il2 B sin (90-θ)

The force F 2on side 2 (da) will be equal
and opposite to F 4 and 
both act along the

same line. Thus, F 2 and F 4 will cancel out
each other.


The magnitudes of forces F 1 and F 3 on
sides 3 (ab) and 1 (cd) will be Il1 B sin 90° i.e.,
Il1 B. These two forces do not act along the
same line and hence they produce a net torque.
This torque results into rotation of the loop so
that
 the loop is perpendicular to the direction of
B , the magnetic field. The moment arm is
1
(l2 sin θ ) about the central axis of the loop.
2


The torque τ due to forces F 1 and F 3 will then
be

τ = (Il1 B l2 sin θ ) + (Il1 B l2 sin θ )

If the current carrying loop is made up of
multiple turns N, in the form of a flat coil, the
total torque will be
τ' = Nτ = N I l1 l2 B sin θ
τ' = (NIA)B sin θ
--- (10.23)
A = l1l2
Here A is the area enclosed by the coil.
The above equation holds good for all flat
(planar) coils irrespective of their shape, in a
uniform magnetic field.

Can you recall?
How does the coil in a motor rotate by a full
rotation? In a motor, we require continuous
rotation of the current carrying coil. As the
plane of the coil tendsto become parallel
to the magnetic field B , the current in the
coil is reversed externally. Referring to
Fig. 10.10, the segment ab occupies the
position cd. At this position of rotation, the
current is reversed. Instead offrom b to a,
it flows from a to b, force F m continues
to act in the same direction so that the
torque continues to rotate the coil. The
reversal of the current is achieved by using
a commutator which connects the wires
of the power supply to the coil via carbon
brush contacts.

d

Fig. 10.13: Moving coil galvanometer.

Larger the current is, larger is the deflection
and larger is the torque due to the spring. If the
deflection is φ, the restoring torque due to the
spring is equal to K φ where K is the torsional
constant of the spring.
Thus, K φ = NIAB,
 NAB 
and the deflection φ = 
 I --- (10.24)
 K 
Thus the deflection φ is proportional to
the current I. Modern instruments use digital
ammeters and voltmeters and do not use such
a moving coil galvanometer.
10.8 Magnetic Dipole Moment:
In the preceding section, we have dealt
with a current carrying coil. This current
carrying
coil can be described with a vector

µ , its magnetic dipole moment. If n is a unit
vector normal
 to the plane of the coil, the
direction of µ is the direction of n shown
in Fig. 10.12 (b). We can then define the
magnitude of µ as
µ = NIA, 		
--- (10.25)
where N is the number of turns of the coil, I
the current passing through the coil, A the area
enclosed by each turn of the coil.

If held in uniform magnetic field B , the
torque responsible for the rotation of the coil,
according to Eq. (10.23) will be
τ = µB sin θ ,

10.7.1 Moving Coil Galvanometer:
A current in a circuit or a voltage of a
battery can be measured in terms of a torque
exerted by a magnetic field on a current
carrying coil. Analog voltmeters and ammeters
work on this principle. Figure 10.13 shows a
cross sectional diagram of a galvanometer.
It consists of a coil of several turns
mounted (suspended or pivoted) in such a way
that it can freely rotate about a fixed axis, in
a radial uniform magnetic field. A soft iron
cylindrical core makes the field radial and
strong. The coil rotates due to a torque acting
on it as the current flows through it. This torque
is given by (Eq. 10.23)
τ = N I A.B, where A is the area of the
coil, B the strength of the magnetic field, N the
number of turns of the coil and I the current in
the coil. Here, sin θ = 1 as the field is radial
(plane of the coil will always be parallel to
the field). However, this torque is counter
balanced by a torque due to a spring fitted as
shown in the Fig. 10.13.
This counter torque balances the magnetic
torque, so that a fixed steady current I in the
coil produces a steady angular deflection φ .

After considering straight parallel wires
let us obtain the magnetic field at a point
produced by a current in a circular arc of a
wire. Figure 10.18 depicts a circular arc of a
wire (AB), carrying a current I. We can first
obtain the magnetic field produced by one
current-length element of the arc and then
integrate over the entire arc length. The circular
arc AB subtends an angle θ at the centre O of
the circle of which the arc is a part, and r is its
radius. Using Biot-Savart law Eq. (10.34), the

10.15 Ampere's Law:
We know that if a distribution of charges
is given, one can obtain the electric field by
using the inverse square law. If the distribution
of charges is planar, or has spherical or
cylindrical symmetry, then with the help
of Gauss' Law we can find the net electric
field with relative ease. On similar note, we
can obtain the magnetic field produced by a
distribution of currents (not charges!).
Again, if the distribution of currents has
some symmetry, then we can use Ampere's
law to find out the magnetic field with fair
ease, as you will see below. You have studied
Biot-Savart law and its consequences. The
Ampere's law can be derived from Biot-Savart
Law. The law is due to Andre' Marie Ampere
(1775-1836) after whom the SI unit of current
is named.

law is:

Fig. 10.22: Amperian Loop.

Thus the integration is over the product
of length dl of the Amperian loop and the
component of the magnetic field Bcos θ ,
tangent to the loop.
We use the curled-palm right hand rule
so that we can mark the currents with positive
sign or negative sign. Curl the right hand palm
along the Amperian loop, with fingers in the
direction of integration. Then a current in the
direction of the stretched thumb is assigned
positive sign and the current in the direction
opposite to the stretched thumb is assigned
negative sign.
For the distribution of currents as shown
in Fig. 10.22, I1 and I2 are coming out of the
paper, () parallel to the stretched thumb.
Hence these are positive. I3, on the other hand
is going into the plane of the paper (). Thus,
it is negative.

The sign ∫ indicates that the integral
is to be evaluated over a closed loop called
Amperian loop. The current I on the right
hand side is the net current encircled by the
Amperian loop. In an example shown in Fig.
10.22, cross-sections of four long straight wires
carrying currents I1, I2, I3, I4 into or out of the
plane of the paper are shown. An Amperian

You have studied Gauss' law in
electrostatics as well as magnetism. The
above example shows that if the distribution
of currents has a high degree of symmetry
such as cylindrical symmetry in case of a
long wire, then the magnetic field for the
given distribution of currents can be easily
calculated. It will then become unnecessary to
solve the integrals which appear in the BiotSavart law.
We note here that the Biot-Savart law
plays a role in magnetostatics that Coulomb's
law plays in electrostatics. On parallel lines,
we can say that what the role Gauss' law
plays in electrostatics, plays the Ampere's law
in magnetostatics.

10.16 Magnetic Field of a Solenoid and a
Toroid: (a) Solenoid:
You have learnt about a solenoid in
XIth Std. qualitatively. Consider a long, closely
wound helical coil of a conducting wire. We
assume that the diameter of the coil is much
smaller than its length. Figure 10.24 shows
the schematic diagram of a cross section of
a current carrying solenoid. The density of
the magnetic field lines along the axis of the
solenoid within the solenoid and at a certain
distance away from the wire, is uniform. Hence
the magnetic field B is parallel to the axis
of the solenoid. The lines are widely spaced
outside the solenoid and hence the magnetic
field is weak there.
For a real solenoid of finite length,
magnetic field is uniform and has a good
246

strength at the centre and comparatively weak
at the outside of the coil.

In the above equation, I is the net current
encircled by the loop.
∴ B.L + 0 + 0 + 0 = µ0I

The second
and
fourth
integrals
are

zero because B and d l are perpendicular to
each other. The third integral is zero because
outside the solenoid, B = 0. We can obtain the
net current I.
If the number of turns is n per unit length
of the solenoid and the current flowing through
the wire is i, then the net current coming out of
the plane of the paper is

What are magnetic lines of

Why magnetic monopoles do not exist?
Which materials are used in making

Fig. 11.1: Short bar magnet suspended freely
with an inextensible string.

11.1 Introduction:
You have studied about magnetic dipole
and dipole moment due to a short bar magnet.
Also you have studied about magnetic field due
to a short bar magnet at any point in its vicinity.
When such a small bar magnet is suspended
freely, it remains along the geographic North
South direction. (This property can be readily
used in Navigation.)
In the present Chapter you will learn
about the behaviour of a short bar magnet
kept in two mutually perpendicular magnetic
fields. You will also learn about different
types of magnetism, viz. diamagnetism,
paramagnetism and ferromagnetism with their
properties and examples. At the end you will
learn about the applications of magnetism
such as permanent magnet, electromagnet,
and magnetic shielding.

Try this
Now we will extend the above experiment
further by bringing another short bar magnet
near to the freely suspended magnet.
Observe the change when the like and
unlike poles of the two magnets are brought
near each other. Draw conclusion. Does
the suspended magnet rotate continuously
or rotate through certain angle and remain
stable?
11.2 Torque Acting on a Magnetic Dipole in
a Uniform Magnetic Field:
You have studied in the preivous Chapter
of that the torque acting on a rectangular
current carrying coil kept in a uniform
magnetic

where θ is the angle between m and B , the
magnetic dipole moment and the external
applied uniform magnetic field, respectively as
shown in Fig. 11.2. The same can be observed
when a small bar magnet is placed in a uniform
magnetic field. The forces exerted on the poles
of the bar magnet due to magnetic field are
along different lines of action. These forces
form a couple. As studied earlier, the couple
produces pure rotational motion. Analogous to
rectangular magnetic coil in uniform magnetic
field, the bar magnet will follow the same
Eq. (11.1).

Activity
You have already studied in earlier classes
that a short bar magnet suspended freely
always aligns in North South direction
(as shown in Fig. 11.1). Now if you try to
forcefully move and bring it in the direction
along East West and leave it free, you will
observe that the magnet starts turning about
the axis of suspension. Do you know from
where does the torque which is necessary
for rotational motion come from? (as
studied in rotational dynamics a torque is
necessary for rotational motion).

Magnetic field.
Fig. 11.3: Potential Energy v/s angular
position of the magnet.

τ = mB sin θ (m is the magnetic dipole
moment of bar magnet and B the uniform
magnetic field).
Due to the torque the bar magnet will
undergo rotational motion. Whenever a
displacement (linear or angular) is taking
place, work is being done. Such work is stored
in the form of potential energy in the new
position (refer to Chapter 8). When the electric
dipole is kept in the electric field the energy
stored is the electrostatic Potential energy.

activity (Refer Fig. 11.1) we observe that
the magnet rotates through angle and then
becomes stationary. This happens because
of the restoring torque as studied in Chapter
10 generated in the string opposite to the
deflecting torque. In equilibrium both the
torques balance.

on the magnet is clockwise. Now if one tries
to rotate the magnet anticlockwise through an
angle dθ, then there will be a restoring torque
acting as given by the equation, in opposite
direction.

Observe and discuss
What is a North pole or South pole of a
bar magnet? For understanding this, you
just have to draw a circular loop on a plane
glass plate and show the direction of current
(say clockwise direction). Now place on
it a wire loop having clockwise current
flowing through it. According to right hand
rule, the top surface will behave as a South
pole. Now just turn the glass and see the
same loop through other surface of glass.
You will find that the direction of current is
in anticlockwise direction (in reality there
is no change in the direction of current) and
hence the loop side surface behaves like
North pole.

Vibration Magnetometer:
Vibration

is used for the comparison
of magnetic moments and
magnetic field. This device
works on the principle, that
whenever a freely suspended magnet in a
uniform magnetic field, is disturbed from
its equilibrium positions, it starts vibrating
about the mean position. It can be used to
determine horizontal component of Earth's
magnetic field.
Examples 11.1: A bar magnet of
moment of inertia of 500 g cm2 makes
10 oscillations per minute in a horizontal
plane. What is its magnetic moment, if
the horizontal component of earth's
magnetic field is 0.36 gauss?
Given: Moment of Inertia I = 500 g cm2
Frequency n = 10 oscillation per minute
= 10/60 oscillations per second
Time period T = 6 sec
BH = 0.36 gauss
Solution: From Eq. (11.8),

11.3 Origin of Magnetism in Materials:
In order to understand magnetism in
materials we have to use the basic concepts
such as magnetic poles and magnetic dipole
moment. In XIth Std., you have studied about
the magnetic property of a short bar magnet
such as its magnetic field along its axial
or equatorial direction. What makes some
material behave like a magnet while others
don't? To understand it one must consider the
building blocks of any material i.e., atoms.
In an atom, negatively charged electrons are
revolving about the nucleus (consisting of
protons and neutrons). The details about it will
be studied in Chapter 15. You have studied
in the periodic table in Chemistry in XIth Std.

atom. This also applies to magnetic properties
as described below.
11.3.1 Magnetic Moment of an Electron
Revolving Around the Nucleus of an Atom:
Let us consider an electron revolving
around positively charged nucleus in a circular
orbit as a simple model. A (negatively charged)
electron revolving in an orbit is equivalent
to a tiny current loop. The magnetic dipole
moment due to a current loop is given by
morb = I A (A is the area enclosed by the loop
and I is the current). It is only a part of the
magnetic moment of an atom and is referred
to as orbital magnetic moment. An electron
possesses an intrinsic angular momentum,
the spin angular momentum. Spin magnetic
dipole moment results from this intrinsic spin.
Consider an electron moving with constant
speed v in a circular orbit of radius r about the
nucleus as shown in Fig. 11.4. If the electron
travels a distance of 2πr (circumference of the
circle) in time T, then its orbital speed v=2πr/T.
Thus the current I associated with this orbiting
electron of charge e is

For this electron, orbital angular momentum is
L = me vr ,
where me is the mass of an electron.
Hence the orbital magnetic moment, Eq.
(11.10) can be written as

These magnetic moments are calculated
from the experimental value of magnetic
susceptibility. In several ions the magnetic
moment is due to both orbital and spin
angular momenta.

Observe and discuss
Let us see whether the given atom has
paired electron or unpaired electrons in the
outermost orbit. We will follow three steps1) Write electronic configuration
2) Draw valence orbital
3) Identify if unpaired electron exist
Ex. Chlorine Cl ( it has total 17 electrons)
1) electronic configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2

2) ignoring inner completely filled orbitals
and just considering valence electrons.

3) There is one unpaired electron.
In a similar manner study Fe, Zn, He, B, Ni
and draw your conclusions.

As stated earlier, apart from the orbital
motion, electron spin also contributes to the
resultant magnetic moment of an atom. Vector
sum of these two moments is the total magnetic
moment of the atom.

11.4 Magnetization and Magnetic Intensity:
In the earlier section you have seen that
atoms with unpaired electrons have a net
magnetic dipole moment. The bulk material
is made up of a large number of such atoms
each having an inherent magnetic moment.
The magnetic dipole moments are randomly
oriented and hence the net dipole moment of
many of the bulk materials is zero. For some
materials (such as Fe3O4), the vector addition
of all these magnetic dipole moments may not
be zero. Such materials have a net magnetic
moment. The ratio of magnetic moment to the
volume of the material is called magnetization .
M = mnet / volume
--- (11.12)
M is vector quantity having dimension
[L-1 A and SI units A m-1].
Consider a rod of such a material with
some net magnetization, placed in a solenoid
with n turns per unit length, and carrying
current I. Magnetic field inside the solenoid is
given by

Do you know?
Two possible orientations of spin

angular momentum ( s ) of an electron in
an external magnetic field. Note that the
spin magnetic dipole
moment is in a direction
opposite to that of the
angular momentum.
You have studied Pauli's exclusion
principle. According to it, no two electrons can
have the same set of quantum numbers viz. n,
l, m1 and ms defining a state. Therefore, the
resultant magnetic dipole moment for these
atoms with a pair of electrons in the same
state, defined by n, l and ml, will be zero as
discussed in the box below.
The atoms with odd number of electrons
in their outermost orbit will possess nonzero

Here µ is magnetic permeability of the
material analogous to ε in electrostatics and
µr is the relative magnetic permeability of the
substance.

material kept inside the solenoid by Bm .

can be expressed as

Bm  0 M ,
where µ0 is permeability of free space.
∴ B  0 n I  0 M
--- (11.14)
Here we will introduce one more quantity
called magnetic field intensity H, where
H = nI. The noticeable difference between
the expression for B and H is that H does not
depend on the material rod which is placed
inside the solenoid.

Magnetic Permeability is a term analogous
to permittivity in electrostatics. It basically
tells us about the number of magnetic
lines of force that are passing through
a given substance when it is kept in an
external magnetic field. The number is the
indicator of the behaviour of the material
in magnetic field. For superconductors
χ = - 1. If you substitute in the Eq. (11.18),
it is observed that permeability of material
µ = 0. This means no magnetic lines will
pass through the superconductor.
Magnetic Susceptibility (χ) is the
indicator of measure of the response of
a given material to the external applied
magnetic field. In other words it indicates
as to how much magnetization will be
produced in a given substance when kept
in an external magnetic field. Again it is
analogous to electrical susceptibility. This
means when the substance is kept in a
magnetic field, the atomic dipole moments
either align or oppose the external
magnetic field. If the atomic dipole
moments of the substance are opposing
the field, χ is observed to be negative,
and if the atomic dipole moments align
themselves in the direction of field,
χ is observed to be positive. The number of
atomic dipole moments of getting aligned in
the direction of the applied magnetic field
is proportional to χ. It is large for soft iron
(χ >1000).

that if H is not too strong the magnetization M

11.5 Magnetic Properties of Materials:
The behaviour of a material in presence
of external magnetic field classifies materials
broadly into diamagnetic, paramagnetic
and ferromagnetic materials.
Magnetic
susceptibility for diamagnetic material is
negative and for paramagnetic positive
but small. For ferromagnetic materials it is
positive and large.

11.5.1 Diamagnetism:
In the earlier section it is discussed that
atoms/molecules with completely filled
electron orbit possess no net magnetic
dipole moment. Such materials behave as
diamagnetic materials. When these materials
are placed in external magnetic field they
move from the stronger part of magnetic field
to the weaker part of magnetic field. Unlike
magnets attracting magnetic material, these
materials are repelled by a magnet.
The
simplest
explanation
for
diamagnetism could be given using paired
electron orbit. As discussed earlier, the net
magnetic moment of such atoms is zero. When
the orbiting electron or current loop is brought
in external magnetic field, the field induces a
current as per Lenz’s law (refer to Chapter 12)
as shown in Fig. 11.5. The direction of induced
current Ii, is such that the direction of magnetic
field created by the current is opposite to the
direction of applied external magnetic field.
Out of the pair of orbits, for one loop where the
direction of induced current is the same as that
of loop current will find increase in current I,
(Fig. 11.5 (b)) resulting in increase in magnetic
dipole moment. For the current loop where
the direction of induced current is opposite to
direction of loop current, (Fig. 11.5 (a)) the
net current is reduced, effectively reducing
the magnetic dipole moment. This results in
net magnetic dipole moment opposite to the
direction of applied external magnetic field.

Examples of diamagnetic materials are
copper, gold metal, bismuth and many metals,
lead, silicon, glass, water, wood, plastics etc.
Diamagnetic property is present in all materials.
In some, it is weaker than other properties such
as paramagnetism or ferromagnetism which
mask the diamagnetism.

Try this
Take a bar magnet (available in your
laboratory), a small glass test tube with a
cork partially filled with water and fixed on
the piece of such a material say wood (float)
that this system can float on water, . Let the
test tube and the float be kept floating in a
water bath or some plastic tray contining
water available in the laboratory. Bring the
pole of the bar magnet near the water filled
glass tube. Note your observation. Repeat
the experiment without water filled in the
test tube. Record your observation and draw
conclusions.

Fig. 11.6: Diamagnetic substance in uniform
magnetic field.

When diamagnetic material is placed
in an external magnetic field, the induced
magnetic field inside the material repels the
magnetic lines of forces resulting in reduction
in magnetic field inside the material (See Fig.
11.6). Similarly when diamagnetic material
is placed in non uniform magnetic field, it
moves from stronger to weaker part of the
field. If a diamagnetic liquid is filled in a
U tube and one arm of the U tube is placed
in an external magnetic field, the liquid is
pushed in the arm which is outside the field.
In general, these materials try to move to a
place of weaker magnetic field. If a rod of
diamagnetic material is suspended freely in the
magnetic field it aligns itself in the direction
perpendicular to the direction of external
magnetic field. This is because there is a torque
acting on induced dipole. As studied earlier,
when the dipole is in a direction opposite to
the direction of magnetic field it has a large
magnetic potential energy and so is unstable.
It will try to go into a position where the
magnetic potential energy is least and that is
when the rod is perpendicular to the direction
of magnetic field. The magnetic susceptibility
of diamagnetic material is negative.

Do you know?
When superconductors (χ = - 1) are placed
in an external magnetic field, the field lines
are completely expelled. The phenomenon
of perfect diamagnetism in superconductor
is called Meissner effect. If a good electrical
conductor is kept in a magnetic field, the
field lines do penetrate the surface region
to a certain extent.
11.5.2 Paramagnetism:
In the earlier section you have studied that
atoms/molecules having unpaired electrons
possess a net magnetic dipole moment. As
these dipole moments are randomly oriented,
the resultant magnetic dipole moment of the
material is, however, zero.

As seen from Fig. 11.7 (a) and (b), each
atom/molecule of a paramagnetic material
possesses net magnetic dipole moment, but
because of thermal agitation these are randomly

ariented. Due to this the net magnetic dipole
moment of the material is zero in absence of
an external magnetic field.
When such materials are placed in
sufficiently strong external magnetic field at
low temperature (to reduce thermal excitation)
(Fig. 11.7 (c)), most of the magnetic dipoles
align themselves in the direction of the applied
field (to align in the direction corresponding to
less potential energy). The field lines get closer
inside such a material (see Fig. 11.8).

--- (11.21)

Thus when we increase the applied
magnetic field and reduce the temperature,
more number of magnetic moments align
themselves in the direction of magnetic field
resulting in increase in Magnetization.

Fig . 11.8: Paramagnetic substance
in external magnetic field.

Classify the following atoms as
diamagnetic or paramagnetic.
H, O, Zn, Fe, F, Ar, He
(Hint : Write down their electronic
configurations)
Is it true that all substances with even
number of electrons are diamagnetic?

When paramagnetic material is placed in
a nonuniform magnetic field it tend to move
itself from weaker region to stronger region.
In other words, these materials are strongly
attracted by external magnetic field. When
a paramagnetic liquid is placed in a U tube
manometer with a magnet kept in close vicinity
of one of the arms, it is observed that the liquid
rises into the arm close to the magnet.
When the external magnetic field is
removed these magnetic dipoles get arranged
themselves in random directions. Thus the net
magnetic dipole moment is reduced to zero in
the absence of a magnetic field. Metals such as
magnesium, lithium, molybdenum, tantalum,
and salts such as MnSO4, H2O and oxygen gas
are examples of paramagnetic materials.
In 1895 Piere Curie observed that the
magnetization M in a paramagnetic material
is directly proportional to applied magnetic
field B and inversely proportional to absolute
temperature T of the material. This is known
as Curie Law.

11.5.3 Ferromagnetism:
Atoms/molecules
of
ferromagnetic
material possess magnetic moments similar
to those in paramagnetic materials. However,
such substances exhibit strong magnetic
properties and can become permanent
magnets. Metals and rare earths such as iron,
cobalt, nickel and some transition metal alloys
exhibit ferromagnetism.
Domain theory: In ferromagnetic materials
there is a strong interaction called exchange
coupling or exchange interaction between
neighbouring magnetic dipole moments.
Due to this interaction, small regions
are formed in which all the atoms have
their magnetic moments aligned in the same
direction. Such a region is called a domain and
the common direction of magnetic moment is
called the domain axis. Domain size can be
a fraction of a millimetre (10-6 - 10-4 m) and
contains about 1010 - 1017 atoms. The boundary

259

between adjacent domains with a different
orientation of magnetic moment is called a
domain wall.

Remember this
We have classified materials as diamagnetic,
paramagnetic
and
ferromagnetic.
However there exist additional types of
magnetic materials such as ferrimagnetic,
antiferrimagnetic, spin glass etc. with
the exotic properties leading to various
applications.

Do you know?
Exchange Interaction: This exchange
interaction in stronger than usual dipoledipole interaction by an order of magnitude.
Due to this exchange interaction, all the
atomic dipole moments in a domain get
aligned with each other. Find out more
about the origin of exchange interaction.

Example 11.3: A domain in ferromagnetic
iron is in the form of cube of side 1 µm.
Estimate the number of iron atoms in the
domain, maximum possible dipole moment
and magnetisation of the domain. The
molecular mass of iron is 55 g/mole and
density is 7.9 g/cm3. Assume that each iron
atom has a dipole moment of 9.27 × 10-24
Am2.
Solution: The volume of the cubic domain
V = (10-6)3 = 10-18 m3 = 10-12 cm3
mass = volume × density = 7.9 × 10-12 g.
An Avogadro number (6.023 x 1023) of iron
atoms has mass 55 g.
The number of atoms in the domain N

In unmagnetized state, the domain axes
of different domains are oriented randomly,
resulting in the net magnetic moment of the
whole material to be zero, even if the magnetic
moments of individual domains are nonzero as
shown in Fig. 11. 9 (a).
When an external magnetic field is
applied, domains try to align themselves along
the direction of the applied magnetic field. The
number of domains aligning in that direction
increases as magnetic field is increased. This
process is referred to as flipping or domain
rotation. When sufficiently high magnetic field
is applied, all the domains coalesce together to
form a giant domain as shown in Fig. 11.9 (b).

The maximum possible dipole moment mmax
is achieved for the case when all the atomic
moments are perfectly aligned (though this
will not be possible in reality).
mmax = 8.65 × 1010 × 9.27 × 10-24

Fig. 11.9: Unmagnetised (a) and magnetised
(b) ferromagnetic material with domains.

In
nonuniform
magnetic
field
ferromagnetic material tends to move from
weaker part to stronger part of the field.
When the strong external magnetic field
is completely removed, it does not set the
domain boundaries back to original position
and the net magnetic moment is still nonzero
and ferromagnetic material is said to retain
magnetization. Such materials are used in
preparing permanent magnets.

11.5.4 Effect of Temperature:
Ferromagnetism
depends
upon
temperature. As the temperature of a
ferromagnetic material is increased, the
domain structure starts distorting because the
exchange coupling between neightbouring
moments weakens. At a certain temperature,
depending upon the material, the domain
260

structure collapses totally and the material
behaves like paramagnetic material. The
temperature at which a ferromagnetic material
transforms into a paramagnetic substance is
called Curie temperature (Tc­) of that material.
The relation between the magnetic
susceptibility of a material when it has acquired
paramagnetic property and the temperature T
is given by

Fig. 11.11: Hysteresis cycle (loop).

Knowing the value of H (= nI) and M, one
can calculate the corresponding magnetic field
B from the above equation. Figure 11.11 shows
the behaviour of the material as we take it
through one cycle of magnetisation. At point O
in the graph the material is in nonmagnetised
state. As the strength of external magnetic
intensity H is increased, B also increases as
shown by the dotted line. But the increase
is non linear. Near point a, the magnetic
field is at its maximum value which is the
saturation magnetization condition of the rod.
This represents the complete alignment and
merger of domains. If H is increased future,
(by increasing the current flowing through the
solenoid) there is no increase in B.
This process is not reversible. At this stage
if the current in the solenoid is reduced, the
earlier path of the graph is not retraced. (Earlier
domain structure is not recovered). When
H = 0 (current through the solenoid is made
zero, point b in the figure) we do not get
B = 0. The value of B when H = 0 is called
retentivity or remanence. This means some
domain alignment is still retained even
when H = 0. Next, when the current in the
solenoid is increased in the reverse direction,
point c in the graph is reached, where
B = 0 at a certain value of H. This value of H
is called coercivity. At this point the domain

11.6 Hysteresis:
The behaviour of ferromagnetic material
when placed in external magnetic field is quite
interesting and informative. It is nonlinear and
provides information of magnetic history of
the sample. To understand this, let us consider
an unmagnetized ferromagnetic material in
the form of a rod placed inside a solenoid. On
passing the current through solenoid, magnetic
field is generated which magnetises the rod.
Knowing the value of χ of the material of
the rod, M (magnetization) can be easily
calculated from M = χ H. From Eq. (11.16),
261

(Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy.
Permanent magnets are prepared by using a
hard ferromagnetic rod instead of soft used
in earlier case. When the current is switched
on, magnetic field of solenoid magnetises the
rod. As the hard ferromagnetic material has a
property to retain the magnetization to larger
extent, the material remains magnetised even
after switching off the current through the
solenoid.

axes are randomly oriented with respect to
each other. If the current is further increased,
in the reverse direction, B increases and again
reaches a saturation state (point d). Here if H
is increase further, B does not increase. From
this point d onwards, when H is reduced, B
also reduces along the path de. At this point
e, again H = 0 but B is not zero. It means
domain structure is present but the direction of
magnetisation is reversed. Further increase in
the current, gives the curve efa. On reaching
point a, one loop is complete. This loop is
called hysteresis loop and the process of taking
magnetic material through the loop once is
called hysteresis cycle.

Do you know?
What is soft magnetic material?
Soft ferromagntic materials can be
easily magnetized and demagnetized.

Can you recall?
Do you recall a similar loop/effect?
It is similar to stress hysteresis you have
studied in mechanical properties of solid in
XIth Std. The stress strain curve for increasing
and decreasing load was discussed. Area

during deformation of the material.

(hysteresis curve) indicate?

11.8 Magnetic Shielding:
When a soft ferromagnetic material is
kept in a uniform magnetic field, large number
of magnetic lines crowd up inside the material
leaving a few outside. If we have a closed
structure of this material, say a spherical shell
of iron kept in magnetic field, very few lines
of force pass through the enclosed space. Most
of the lines will be crowded into the iron shell
(Fig. 11.12). This effect is known as magnetic
shielding. The instrument which need to be
protected from magnetic field is completely
surrounded by a soft ferromagnetic substance.
This technique is being used in space ships.
Some scientific experiments require the
experiment to be protected from magnetic field
in the laboratory. There, high magnetic fields
of magnets need to be shielded by providing a
case made up of soft ferromagnetic material.

11.7 Permanent Magnet and Electromagnet:
Soft iron having large permeability
(>1000) and small amount of retaining
magnetization, is used to make electromagnets.
For this purpose, a soft iron rod (or that of
a soft ferromagnetic material) is placed in a
solenoid core. On passing current through the
solenoid, the magnetic field associated with
solenoid increases thousand folds. When the
current through the solenoid is switched off, the
associated magnetic field effectively becomes
zero. These electromagnets are used in electric
bells, loud speakers, circuit breakers, and also
in research laboratories. Giant electromagnets
are used in cranes to lift heavy loads made
of iron. Superconducting magnets are used to
prepare very high magnetic fields of the order
of a few tesla. Such magnets are used in NMR

There are different types of shielding available
like electrical and accoustic shielding apart
from magnetic shielding discussed above.
Electrical insulator functions as an electrical
barrier or shield and comes in a wide array of
materials. Normally the electrical wires used
in our households are also shielded. In case of
audio recording it is necessary to reduce other
stray sound which may interfere with the sound
to be recorded. So the recording studios are
sound insulated using acoustic material.

12.1 Introduction:
So far, we have focussed our attention
on the generation of electric fields by
stationary charges and magnetic fields by
moving charges. During the early decades of
nineteenth century, Oersted, Ampere and a
few others established the fact that electricity
and magnetism are inter-related. A question
was then naturally raised whether the converse
effect of – the moving electric charges produce
magnetic fields – was possible? That is, can we
produce electric current by moving magnets?
In 1831, Faraday in England performed
a series of experiments in connection with
the generation of electric current by means
of magnetic flux. In the same year Joseph
Henry (1799-1878) demonstrated that electric
currents were indeed produced in closed
circuits or coils when subjected to timevarying magnetic fields. The outcome of these
experiments led to a very basic and important
law of electromagnetism known as Faraday's
law of induction. An electromotive force (emf)
and, therefore, a current can be induced in
various processes that involve a change in
magnetic flux. The experimental observations
of Faraday are summarized as given below:
i) When a magnet approaches a closed
circuit consisting of a coil (Fig. 12.1), it
produces a current in it. This current is
known as induced current.

Fig. 12.2: Two coils with their planes
facing each other.

vii) Instead of a magnet and a closed circuit,
two coils with their planes facing each
other (Fig. 12.2) also produce similar
effects as mentioned above in experiments
from (i) to (vi). One coil is connected
265

This law is a qualitative law as it only
indicates the characteristics of induced emf.
Second law: The magnitude of induced emf
produced in the circuit is directly proportional
to the rate of change of magnetic flux
linked with the circuit. This law is known as
quantitative law as it gives the magnitude of
induced emf.
If φ is the magnetic flux linked with the
coil at any instant t, then the induced emf.

If φ ' is the flux associated with single

in series with a battery, rheostat and
key while the ends of the other coil are
connected to a galvanometer (G). The
coil which consists of a source of emf (a
battery) is termed as primary coil while
the other as secondary coil. With these
two coils, following observations are
made:
(i) When the circuit in the primary coil is
closed or broken, a momentary deflection
is produced in the galvanometer at
the time of make or break. When the
circuit is closed or broken the directions
of deflection in the galvanometer are
opposite to each other.
(ii) When there is a relative motion between
the two coils (with their circuits closed),
an induced current is produced in the
secondary coil but it exists so long as there
is a relative motion between the coils.
(iii) Whenever the current in the primary coil
is changed (either increased or decreased)
by sliding the rheostat-jockey, a deflection
is produced in the galvanometer. This
indicates the presence of induced current.
The induced current exists so long as there
is a change of current in the primary coil.
The above observations indicate that so
long as there is a change of magnetic flux
(produced either by means of a magnet or
by a current carrying coil) inside a coil,
an induced emf is produced. The direction
of induced emf reverses if instead of
increasing the flux, the flux is decreased
or vice versa.
12.2 Faraday's Laws of Electromagnetic
Induction:
On the basis of experimental evidences,
Faraday enunciated following laws concerning
electromagnetic induction.
First law: Whenever there is a change of
magnetic flux in a closed circuit, an induced
emf is produced in the circuit.

This is also known as 'flux rule' according
to which the emf is equal to the rate at which
the magnetic flux through a conducting circuit
is changing.

In SI units e is measured in volt and
dt
is measured in weber/s.
We have already learnt while studying the
magnetic effect of current that the charges in
motion (or current) can exert force/torque on a
stationary magnet (compass meedle). Now we
have observed in Faraday's experiments that
a bar magnet in motion (or a time- varying
magnetic field) can exert a force on the
stationary charges inside the conductor and
causes an induced emf across the ends of the
conductor (open circuit)/or generates induced
current in a closed circuit.
266

12.3 Lenz's Law:
H.F.E. Lenz (1804-1864) without
knowledge of the work of Michael Faraday
and Joseph Henry duplicated many of their
discoveries independently almost at the same
time.
For determining the direction of an
induced current in a loop, Lenz devised a
rule, which goes by his name as Lenz's Law.
According to this rule, the direction of induced
current in a circuit is such that the magnetic
field produced by the induced current opposes
the change in the magnetic flux that induces
the current. The direction of induced emf is
same as that of induced current. In short, the
induced emf tends to set up a current the action
of which opposes the change that causes it.
Applications of Lenz's law:
12.3.1 Motion of a Magnet Toward a Loop:
In order to get a feel for Lenz's law, let
us consider a north pole of a magnet moving
toward a conducting loop as shown in the Fig.
12.3.

clockwise direction as shown in Fig. 12.3.
If the magnet is pulled away from the
loop, a current will again be induced in the
loop in such a way that the loop will have a
south pole facing the retreating north pole and
will oppose the retreat by attracting it. The
induced current in the loop will now flow in
clockwise direction.
Jumping Ring Experiment: A coil is
wound around an iron core which is held
vertically upright. A metallic ring is placed
on top of the iron core. A current is then
switched on to pass through the coil. This
will make the ring jump several meters in
air.
Explanation: Before the current in the coil
is turned on, the magnetic flux through the
ring is zero. Afterwards, the flux appears in
the coil in upward direction. This change
in flux causes an induced emf and induced
current as well in the ring. The direction of
induced current in the ring will be opposite
to the direction of current in the coil, as
dictated by Lenz’s law. As the opposite
currents repel, the ring flies off in air.
12.3.2 Energy Conservation in Lenz's Law:
We have learnt that the cause of the
induced current may be either (i) the motion
of a conductor (wire) in a magnetic field or
(ii) the change of magnetic flux through a
stationary circuit.
In the first case, the direction of induced
current in the moving conductor (wire) is
such that the direction of the thrust exerted on
the conductor (wire) by the magnetic field is
opposite to the direction of its motion and thus
opposes the motion of the conductor.
In the second case, the current sets up a
magnetic field of its own which within the area
bounded by the circuit is
(a) opposite to the original magnetic field if
this field is increasing; but
(b) in the same direction as the original field,
if the field is decreasing.

Fig. 12.3: Magnet's motion creates a magnetic
dipole in the coil.

As the magnet is moved toward the loop,
a current is induced in the loop. The induced
current in the loop produces a magnetic dipole.
The dipole is oriented in such a way that it
opposes the motion of the magnet. Thus the
loop's north pole must face the approaching
north pole of the magnet so as to repel it.
The curled right-hand (RH) rule for magnetic
dipole or magnetic field will provide the
direction of induced current in the loop. The
induced current in the loop will be in counter
267

The screw driver rule fixes the positive
sense of circulation around the loop as the
clockwise direction.
As the sense of the induced current in the
loop is counter clockwise (negative), the sense
of induced emf also is negative (-ve). That
is, the LHS of Eq. (12.5) is indeed a negative
(-ve) quantity in order to be equal to the RHS.
Thus the negative (-ve) sign in the
d
equation e  
incorporates Lenz's law
dt
into Faraday's law.
12.4 Flux of the Field:
The concept of flux of the magnetic field
is vital to our understanding of Faraday's law.
As shown in Fig. 12.4
 (a), consider a
small element of area da . A direction is
assigned to this element of area such that if
the curve bounding the area is traversed in the
direction of the arrow then the normal comes
out of the plane of paper towards the reader.
In other words it is the direction in which right
handed screw will move if rotated in the sense
of the arrow on the curve.

Thus it is the 'change in flux' through the
circuit (not the flux itself), which is opposed by
the induced current.
Lenz's law follows directly from the
conservation of energy. If an induced current
flows in a circuit in such a direction that it
helps the cause that produces it, then we will
soon find that the induced current and the
magnetic flux penetrating the loop would lead
to an infinite growth. The induced current
once started flowing in the loop would keep
increasing indefinitely producing joule heating
at no extra cost and thus be self-sustaining
(perpetual motion machine). This will violate
the law of conservation of energy. We thus see
that Lenz's law is a necessary consequence of
the law of conservation of energy.
The opposing sense of the induced current
is one manifestation of a general statement of
Lenz's law: "Every effect of induction acts in
opposition to the cause that produces it"
In order to have an induced current, we
must have a closed circuit. If a conductor is not
forming a closed circuit we mentally construct
a circuit between the two ends of the conductor/
wire and use Lenz's law to determine the
direction of induced current. Then the polarity
of the ends of the open-circuited conductor can
be found easily.

attention to the negative (-ve) sign.

that the magnetic field B will not be the

currents are very small producing negligible
magnetic field.
As the flux φ through the frame ABCD

written as

area. Therefore the
 area is divided into small
sections of area da so as to calculate the flux

In S.I. units the emf, e will be in volt, the

 From Eq. (12.9) we can see that even if
B does not change with time, flux may still
vary if the area S changes with time.
12.5 Motional Electromotive Force:
a) Translational motion of a conductor:
As shown in Fig. 12.5, a rectangular
frame of wires ABCD of area(l x) is situated
in a constant magnetic field ( B ). As the wire
BC
 of length l is moved out with velocity
v to increase x the area of the
 loop ABCD
increases. Thus the flux of B through the
loop increases with time. According to the
'Flux Rule' the induced emf will be equal to
the rate at which the magnetic flux through a
conducting circuit is changing as stated in Eq.
(12.9). The induced emf will cause a current
in the loop. It is assumed that there is enough

where v is the velocity of wire BC
increasing the length x of wires AB and CD.
Now we can understand the above result
from the magnetic forces on the charges in the
moving wire BC.

 BC, experiences Lorentz force

B and hence is parallel to wire BC. The
force F is constant along the length l of the
wire BC (as v and B are constant) and zero
elsewhere (... v = 0 for stationary part CDAB
of wire frame). When the charge q moves a
distance l along the wire, the work done by the
Lorentz force is W = F.l=

In general, it can be proved that for any
circuit whose parts move in a fixed magnetic
field, the induced emf is the time derivative of
flux ( φ ) regardless of the shape of the circuit.
The flux rule is also applicable in case
of a wire loop that is kept stationary and
the magnetic field is changed. The Lorentz
force
onthe electrical
charges is given by


F = q ( E  v  B ) . There are no new special
forces due to changing magnetic fields.
Any force on charges at 
rest in a stationary
wire comes from the E -term. Faraday's
observations led to the discovery that electric
and magnetic fields are related by a new law:
In a region where magnetic field is changing
with time, electric fields are generated. It is
this electric field which drives the electrons
around the conductor circuit and as such is
responsible for the induced emf in a stationary
circuit whenever there is a changing magnetic
flux.
The flux rule holds good so long as the
change in the magnetic flux is due to the
changes in magnetic field or due to the motion
of the circuit or both.
b) Motional emf in a rotating bar:
A rotating bar is different in nature from
the sliding bar. As shown in Fig. 12.6, consider
a small segment dr of the bar at a distance r
from the pivot. It is a short length dr of the

conductor which is moving with velocity v
in magnetic field B and has an induced emf
generated in it like a sliding bar.

By imagining all such segments as a
source of emf, we can find that all these
segments are in series and, therefore, the emfs
of individual segments will be added.
Now we know that the induced emf de in
the small segment dr of the rotating conductor.

Compare the above result with the induced

12.6 Induced emf in a Stationary Coil in a
Changing Magnetic Field:
As shown in Fig. 12.7 (a) in a magnet-coil
system, a permanent bar magnet is mounted
on an arc of a semicircle of radius 50 cm. The
arc is a part of a rigid frame of aluminium and
is suspended at the centre of arc so that whole
system can oscillate freely in its plane. A coil
of about 10,000 turns of copper wire loop the
arc so that the bar magnet can pass through the
coil freely.
When the magnet moves through the coil,
the magnetic flux through the coil changes.
In order to measure the induced emf, a
capacitor (C) and diode (D) are connected
across the coil (Fig. 12.7 (b)) The induced
emf produced in the coil is used for charging
a capacitor through a diode. Then the voltage
developed across the capacitor is measured.
The capacitor may not get charged upto the
peak value in a single swing as the timeconstant (RC) may be larger than the time
during which the emf in the coil is generated.
This may take about a few oscillations to
charge the capacitor to the peak value and is
indicated by the ammeter (mA) which will tell
us when the charging current ceases to flow.
e

Fig. 12.6: A conducting bar rotating around
a pivot at one end in a uniform magnetic field
that is perpendicular to the plane of rotation. A
rotational emf is induced between the ends of
the bar.

As the magnet, kept in the middle of the
arc (Fig. 12.7 (a)), starts far away from the coil
moves through it and recedes, the magnetic
field /flux through the coil changes from a
small value, increases to its maximum and
becomes small again thus inducing an emf.
Actually, there is substantial magnetic field at
the coil only when it is very near the magnet.
The speed of the magnet is largest when
it approaches the coil (placed at the mean
position of the oscillation). Thus the magnetic
field changes quite slowly with time when
the magnet is far away and changes rapidly
when it approaches
the coil. The variation of

magnetic field B (at the coil in mean position)
with time is shown in Fig. 12.7 (c).

The centre of the hump 'bcde' refers to the
time when the magnet is inside the coil. The
flat portion (cd) at the top corresponds to the
finite length of the magnet. The magnetic flux
( φ ) is related to magnetic field (B) through a
constant (effective area = No. of turns × area
of coil).
Now, the induced emf is proportional to
d φ /dt, that is to the slope of the curve in Fig.
12.7 (c). As the slope of the curve is largest at
times t1 and t2, the magnitude of induced emf
will be largest at these times. But Lenz's law
gives minus sign (-) in Eq. 12.3
d 

 e   dt  , which means that emf (e)


is 'negative' when φ is increasing at t1 and
'positive' when φ is decreasing at time t2. This
is shown in Fig. 12.7 (d) relating induced emf
(e) with time (t).
Remember the sequence of two pulses;
one 'negative' and one 'positive' occurs during
just half a cycle of motion of the magnet. On
the return swing of the magnet, they will be
repeated (which one will be repeated first, the
'negative' or 'positive' pulse?).
Now we consider the effect of these pulses
on the charging circuit (Fig. 12.7 (b)) The diode
will conduct only during the 'positive' pulse. At
the first half swing, the capacitor will charge
up to a potential, say e1. During the next half
swing, the diode will be cut off until 'positive'
pulse is produced and then the capacitor will
charge upto a slightly higher potential, say e2.
This will continue for a few oscillations till the
capacitor charges upto its peak value eo by the
voltage/ emf pulse. At this stage ammeter will
show no kick (further increase) in the current
of the circuit.
In order to have an estimate of eo, the
equation for induced emf can be written as

Let us focus our attention on one conductor

emf. When the armature reaches in position
(ii) the conductor is moving parallel to the field

the lines of force and the induced emf/ current
is directed opposite to that in case of (i). The

Do you know?
If a wire without any current is kept in a
magnetic field, then it experiences no force
as shown in figure (a). But when the wire is
carrying a current into the plane of the paper
in the magnetic field, a force will be exerted
on the wire towards the left as shown in the
figure (b). The field will be strengthened
on the right side of the wire where the lines
of force are in the same direction as that of
the magnetic field and weakened on the left
side where the field lines are in opposite
direction to that of the applied magnetic
field. For a wire carrying a current out of
the plane of the paper, the force will act to
the right as shown in figure (c).

where f is the frequency of revolution of
the coil.
Since the value of sin ωt varies between
+1 and -1, the polarity of the emf changes
with time. The emf has its extremum value at
θ = 90° and 270° as the change in flux is
greatest at these points. As the direction of
induced current changes periodically it is called
as alternating current (AC) (Fig. 12.8 (c)).
The frequency of AC is equal to the number
of times per second, the current changes from
positive (+ve) to negative (-ve) and back
again. The domestic electrical current varies
at a frequency of 50 cycles/second.

12.8 Back emf and back torque:
We know that emf can be generated in
a circuit in different ways. In a battery it is
the chemical force, which gives rise to emf.
In piezoelectric crystals mechanical pressure
generates the emf. In a thermocouple it is the
temperature gradient which is responsible
for producing emf in a circuit containing the
junctions of two metallic wires. In a photo
electric cell, the incident light above a certain
frequency is responsible for producing the emf.
In a Van de Graaff Generator the electrons
are literally loaded into a conveyor belt and
swept along to create a potential difference.
A generator utilises the movement of wire
through a magnetic field to produce motional
emf/current through a circuit. We have
seen that the physical construction of a DC
generator and motor is practically the same.
If a DC generator is connected to a battery,
it will run as a motor. If a motor is turned

(d) Pulsating direct current.

battery it is necessary to generate a steady
or direct current (DC). The reversing action
of commutator can be used to generate
pulsating DC as depicted in Fig. 12.8 (d). The
commutator acts like a rapid switch which
reverses the connections to the armature at just
the right times to match with the reversals in
current. Modern AC motors are more compact
and rugged than the DC motors.

by any external means, it will behave as a
generator. So whenever a motor is running,
its generator action can not be turned off. By
Lenz's law the induced emf will tend to oppose
the change which causes it. In the present case,
the 'cause' is the current through the armature.
Therefore, the induced emf will tend to reduce
the armature current. The induced emf which
is unavoidable due to generator action in a
motor is called back emf. Initially, when a
motor is just starting up, its armature is not
turning and hence it is not producing any back
emf. As the motor starts speeding up the back
emf increases and armature current decreases.
This explains the reason as to why the current
through a motor is larger in the beginning than
when the motor is running at full speed.

wire AB is cutting the magnetic lines of
force perpendicularly, the induced emf is,
therefore, maximum.

The magnetic field is directed vertically
upward from North to South pole. As the

magnetic flux induces current in the loop as
dictated by Lenz's law. The induced current in
the loop gives rise to a force that opposes the
pulling of the loop away from the magnetic
field.
We know that magnitude of magnetic
flux through the loop is

As x decreases, the flux decreases.

Comparing Eq. (12.24) and Eq. (12.26),
we find that the rate of doing mechanical work
is exactly same as the rate of production of
heat energy in the circuit/loop.
Thus the work done in pulling the loop
through the magnetic field appears as heat
energy in the loop.
12.10 Eddy Currents:
Suppose the conducting loop of Fig.
12.9 (a) is replaced by a solid conducting
plate, the relative motion between conductor
and magnetic field induces a current in the
conductor plate (Fig. 12.10 (a)). In this case
again, we encounter an opposing force so we
must do work while moving the conductor with
uniform velocity v. The conduction electrons
making up the induced current do not follow
one path as they do with the loop, but swirl
about within the plate as if they were caught in
an eddy of water. Such a current is called an
eddy current. Eddy current can be represented
by a single path as shown in Fig. 12.10 (a).
The induced current in the conductor plate
is responsible for transfer of the mechanical
energy into heat energy. The dissipation of
energy as heat energy is more apparent in the
arrangement shown in Fig. 12.10 (a), where a
conducting plate, free to rotate about a pivot,
is allowed to swing down like a pendulum
through a magnetic field. In each swing, when
the plate enters and leaves the field, a portion
of its mechanical energy is transformed to heat
energy. After several such swings there is no

12.11 Self-Inductance:
Consider a circuit (coil) in which the
current is changing. The changing current will
vary the magnitude of magnetic flux linked
with the coil (circuit) itself and consequently
an emf will be induced in the circuit.

K
Fig. 12.11: Changing current in a coil.

The production of induced emf, in the
circuit (coil) itself, on account of a change in
the current in it, is termed as the phenomenon
of self-inductance.
Let at any instant, the value of magnetic
flux linked with the circuit itself be φ
277

of induced emf (caused by changing current in
the circuit) produced around the circuit to the
rate of change of current in it.
In order words, the induced emf produced
around the circuit per unit rate of change of
current in it, is defined as the self-inductance
of the circuit.
(iii) When a current increases in the circuit, an
induced emf acts opposite to it. Consequently,
the work will have to be done in order to
establish the magnetic flux associated with a
steady current Io in the circuit.
Work done in time dt is dW = e.I dt

corresponding to current I in it (Fig. 12.11). It
is obvious that φ will be proportional to current
I.
i.e., φ ∝ I
or φ = LI or L = φ /I,
--- (12. 27)
where L is a constant of proportionality and is
termed as the self-inductance (or coefficient of
self induction) of the coil.
For a closely wound coil of N turns, the
same magnetic flux will be linked with all the
turns. When the flux through the coil changes
each turn of the coil contributes towards the
induced emf. Therefore a term flux linkage is
used for a closely wound coil. The flux linkage
for a coil with N turns corresponding to current
I will be written as

Hence, the self-inductance of a circuit is
the ratio of magnetic flux (produced due to

Inductance of a solenoid: If a current i is
established in the windings (turns) of a long
solenoid, the current produces a magnetic flux

of the solenoid is given by L = N φB /i, where
N is the number of turns. N φB is called as

Example 12.6: Consider a uniformly
wound solenoid having N turns and length
L. The core of the solenoid is air. Find the
inductance of the solenoid of N =200, L=20
cm and cross-sectional area, A= 5 cm2.
Calculate the induced emf eL, if the current
flowing through the solenoid decreases at a
rate of 60 A/s.
Solution: The magnetic flux through each
turn of area A in the solenoid is
φB = B⋅A = ( µ0 ni)⋅A (∵Magnetic field
inside a solenoid is B = µ0 ni)
= µ0 (N/L)⋅i⋅ A(∵n is the number of turns
per unit length=N/L)
We know that the inductance (L) of the
solenoid can be written as
L= (N φB )/ i
Substituting the value of φB , we get
L= (N/i)⋅ { µ0 ⋅(N/L)⋅i⋅ A}

This implies that inductance of a solenoid
L ∝ n2, L ∝ d 2. As n is a number per unit
length, inductance can be written as a product
of permeability constant µ0 and a quantity
with dimension of length. This implies that µ0
can be expressed in henry/ meter (H/m).

12.12 Energy Stored in a Magnetic Field:
We have seen that the changing magnetic
flux in a coil causes an induced emf. The
induced emf so produced opposes the change
and hence the energy has to be spent to
overcome it to build up the magnetic field.
This energy may be recovered as heat in a
resistance of the circuit. This fact gives the
logical concept of the energy being stored in
the magnetic field.
We have dealt with a similar problem
in electrostatics where the total electrostatic
energy UE is stored in the medium between the
plates of a capacitor with capacitance C and
charge q held at potential V is
q 2 CV 2
U=

Now we can estimate the energy spent
to build up a current I in a circuit having an
inductance L.

L= µ0 ⋅(N2/L)⋅A
Inserting the given values of N, L and A, we
find
L= (4π⋅10-7Tm/A)⋅(200)2(5⋅10-4m2)/ (20⋅10-4
m)
or L≈ 0.126 mH
The induced emf in the solenoid
eL= − L (di/dt)
eL= − (0.126⋅10−3) (− 60 A/s)=7.56 mV
Example 12.7: The self-inductance of a
closely wound coil of 200 turns is 10 mH.
Determine the value of magnetic flux
through the cross-section of the coil when
the current passing through the coil is
4 mA.					
Solution: Given :
Self-inductance of coil, L = 10 mH,

solenoid is almost zero. Moreover, the energy
stored will be uniformly distributed

volume as the magnetic field B is uniform
everywhere inside the solenoid.

K is usually less than unity. If K =1,
the two coils will be perfectly coupled, and
M = L1 L2 .
(i) If K > 0.5, the two coils are tightly coupled

It may not be always desirable to have a
large value of mutual inductance (M). A large
value of M is desirable for a transformer but
higher M is not desirable for home appliances
such as a electric clothes dryer. A dangerous
emf can be induced on the metallic case of
the dryer if the mutual inductance between its
heating coils and the case is large. In order
to minimise M the heating coils are counter
wound so that their magnetic fields cancel
one another and reduces M with the case of
the dryer.
Theoretically, the coupling between two
coils is never perfect. If two coils are wound
on a common iron core, the coefficient of
coupling (K) can be considered as unity. For
two air-core coils or two coils on separate iron
cores, the coefficient of coupling depends on
the distance between two coils and the angle

of transformers. A transformer is a device used
for changing the voltage of alternating current

between the axes of the two coils. When the
coils are parallel (and in line), the coefficient
K is maximum. If the axes of the coils are at
right angles (and in line), K is minimum. If we
want to prevent interaction between the coils,
the coils should be oriented at right angle to
each other and be kept as far apart as possible.
K-value for radio coils (Radio frequency,
intermediate frequency transformers) lies
between 0.001 to 0.05.

Whenever the magnetic flux linked
with a coil changes, an emf is induced in
the neighbouring coil. In a transformer there
are two coils, primary (p) and secondary (s)
insulated from each other and wound on a soft
iron core as shown in Fig. 12.14. Primary and
secondary coils are called input and output
coils respectively.
When an AC voltage is applied to the
primary coil, the current through the coil
changes sinusoidally causing similar changes
in the magnetic flux through the core. As the
changing magnetic flux is liked with both
primary and secondary coils, emf is induced
in each coil. The magnetic flux linked with the
coil depends upon the number of turns in the
coil.
Let φ be the magnetic flux linked per
turn with both the coils at an instant t. Np and
Ns be the number of turns in the primary and
secondary coil respectively.
Then at the instant t, the magnetic flux

Hybrid cars: In modern days, the electric
and hybrid vehicles take advantage of
electromagnetic induction. The limitation
of such vehicles is the life- time of a battery
which is not long enough to get similar drive
from a full tank of fuel/ petrol. In order to
increase the amount of charge in the battery,
the car acts as a generator whenever it is
applying the brakes. At the time of braking,
the frictional force between the tyres and the
ground provides the necessary torque to the
magnets inside the generator. Thus, the car
takes advantage of back emf which helps
in charging the battery and consequently
leads to a longer drive.

13. AC Circuits
and a capacitor. In this chapter we will
study the passage of AC through resistors,
inductors and capacitors.
13.2 AC Generator:
In the last chapter are have studied that
the source of AC (generator) produces a time
dependent emf (e) given by
e = e0 sin ω t			--- (13.1)
Where e0 is the peak value of emf and ω
is the angular frequency of rotation of the coil
in the AC generator.
As the time variation of current is similar
to that of emf, the current in a circuit connected
to this generator will be of the form
i = i0 sin ( ω t + α)
where α represent the phase difference
between the current (i) and the emf, and i0 is the
peak value of current. From Eq (13.1) it can be
seen that the induced emf varies sinusoidally
with time as shown in Fig. 13.1 below.

Can you recall?

4.

What is Faraday's laws of induction?
What is induced current?
What is an AC generator?
What are alternating current and direct
current?
5. How is the emf generated in an AC
Generator.
13.1 Introduction:
In school you have learnt that there are
two types of supplies of electricity:
(i) DC, the direct current which has fixed
polarity of voltage (the positive and
negative ends of the power supply are
fixed).
(ii) AC, the alternating current for which the
polarity of the voltage keeps changing
periodically.
		 We have studied the generation of AC
voltage in the previous chapter. Because
of low cost and convenience of transport,
the electricity is mostly supplied as AC.
Some of the appliances that we use
at home or offices like TV, computer,
transistor, radio, etc. convert AC to DC
by using a device like rectifier (which
you will study in chapter 16) before using
it. However, there are some domestic
devices like fan, fridge, air conditioner,
induction heater, coil heater, etc., which

Fig. 13.1: Graph of e
versus ω t

From the graph it can be seen that the
direction of the emf is reversed after every half
revolution of the coil. This type of emf is called
the alternating emf and the corresponding
current is called alternating current.
13.3. Average and RMS values:
Alternating voltages and current go
through all values between zero and the peak
value in one cycle.

Remember this
AC shock is attractive, while DC shock is
repulsive, so 220V AC is more dangerous
than 220V DC. Also 220 V AC has a peak
value E0 = ± 2 Erms = ± 1.414 × 220 V = ±
311 V but DC has fixed value of 220 V only.

Peak value: Peak value of an alternating
current (or emf) is the maximum value of
the current (or emf) in either direction.

run directly on AC. Almost all these
devices use components like an inductor
288

We define some specific values which
would be convenient for comparing two
voltage or current waveforms.
a) Average or mean value of AC:
This is the average of all values of the
voltage (or current) over one half cycle. As
can be seen in Fig. 13.1, the average over a full
cycle is always zero since the average value of
sin ω t over a cycle is zero. So the mean value
of AC over a cycle has no significance and the
mean value of AC is defined as the average
over half cycle.

the same resistance (R) in the same time (t) by
passing a steady current of constant magnitude
through it. The value of such steady current is
called the effective value or virtual value or
rms value of the given alternating current and
is denoted by irms. The relation between the rms
value and peak value of alternating current is
given by

Therefore, average value of current or
emf = 0.637 × their peak value
i.e., iav = 0.637 i0 and eav = 0.637 e0
where iav and eav are the average values
of alternating current and emf (voltage)
respectively.
b) Root-mean-square (or rms) value:
A moving coil ammeter and voltmeter
measure the average value of current and
voltage applied across it respectively. It
is obvious therefore that the moving coil
instruments cannot be used to measure the
alternating current and voltages. Hence in order
to measure there quantities it is necessary to
make use of a property which does not depend
upon the changes in direction of alternating
current or voltage. Heating effect depends
upon the square of the current (the square
of the current is always positive) and hence
does not depend upon the direction of flow
of current. Consider an alternating current of
peak value i0, flowing through a resistance R.
Let H be the heat produced in time t. Now the
same quantity of heat (H) can be produced in

The representation of the harmonically
varying quantities as rotating vectors enable
us to use the laws of vector addition for adding
these quantities.
13.5 Different Types of AC Circuits:
In this section we will derive voltage
current relations for individual as well as
combined circuit elements like resistors,
inductors and capacitors, carrying a sinusoidal
current. We assume the capacitor and inductor
to be ideal unless otherwise specified.
(a) AC voltage applied to a resistor:

e = 6 sin 314 t

13.4 Phasors:
The study of AC circuits is much
simplified, if we represent alternating current
and alternating emf as rotating vectors with
the angle between them equal to the phase
difference between the current and emf. These
rotating vectors are called phasors.
A rotating vector that represents a quality
varying sinusoidally with time is called a
phasor and the diagram representing it is
called phasor diagram.
The phasor for alternating emf and
alternating current are inclined to the
horizontal axis at angle ωt or ωt + α. and
rotate in anticlockwise direction. The length
of the arrow represents the maximum value of
the quantity (i0 and e0).
The projection of the vector on fixed axis
gives the instantaneous value of alternating
current and alternating emf. In sine form,
(i = i0 sin ω t) and (e = e0 sin ω t) projection
is taken on Y-axis as shown in Fig. 13.2 (a).
In cosine form i = i0 cost ω t and e = e0 cos ω t
projection is taken X-axis on as shown in Fig.
13.2 (b).

Suppose a resistor of resistance R is
connected to an AC source of emf with
instantaneous value e given by

Where e0 is the peak value of the voltage
and ω is its angular frequency. Let e be the
potential drop across the resistance.
∴ e = iR 				--- (13.3)
... instantaneous emf = instantaneous value
of potential drop

that for a resistor there is zero phase difference
between instantaneous alternating current and
instantaneous alternating emf, i.e., they are in
phase. Both e and i reach zero, minimum and

not more than 5 cm (called B). Connect
the two independently to 1.5 V cell or to a
similar DC voltage and record the respective
current passing through them as IA and IB.
You will notice that the two are the same.

Fig. 13.4 Graph of e and i versus ωt.

Phasor diagram:
In the AC circuit containing R only, current
and voltage are in the same phase, hence both
phasors for i and for e are in the same direction
making an angle ωt with OX. Their projections
on vertical axis give their instantaneous values.
The phase angle between alternating current
and alternating voltage through R is zero as
shown in Fig. 13.5.

(b) AC voltage applied to an Inductor:
Let us now connect the source of
alternating emf to a circuit containing pure
inductor (L) only as shown in Fig. 13.6. Let
us assume that the inductor has negligible
resistance. The circuit is therefore a purely
inductive circuit. Suppose the alternating emf
supplied is represented by
e = e0 sin ω t 			--- (13.5)

resistive circuit.

given by e = 140 sin 3142 t is connected

opposite to the induced emf (e'). According

the voltage by 90°, so the phasor representing
i0 is turned clockwise with the direction of e0 as
shown in Fig. 13.8.

Constant of integration is time independent
and has the dimensions of i. As the emf
oscillates about zero, i also oscillates about
zero so that there cannot be any component of

Thus, the integration constant is zero

Comparing Eq (13.8) with Ohm's law,
e
i0 = 0 we find that ω L represents the
R
effective resistance offered by the inductance
L, it is called the inductive reactance and
denoted by XL.
∴ XL = ω L = 2πf L. (... ω = 2π/T = 2πf )
where f is the frequency of the AC supply.
The function of the inductive reactance
is similar to that of the resistance in a purely
resistive circuit. It is directly proportional to
the inductance (L) and the frequency (f) of the
alternating current.

Comparing Eq. (13.5) and (13.7) we find
that the alternating current i lags behind the
alternating voltage emf e by a phase angle of

The current flowing in the circuit transfers
charge to the plates of the capacitor which
produces a potential difference between the
plates. As the current reverses its direction in
each half cycle, the capacitor is alternately
charged and discharged.
Suppose q is the charge on the capacitor
at any given instant t. The potential difference
across the plates of the capacitor is

The dimensions of inductive reactance is
the same as those of resistance and its SI unit

In DC circuits f = 0 ∴XL = 0
It implies that a pure inductor offers zero
resistance to DC, i.e., it cannot reduce DC.
Thus, its passes DC and blocks AC of very
high frequency.
In an inductive circuit, the self induced
emf opposes the growth as well as decay of
current.

by Z. The reciprocal of impedance of an AC
circuit is called admittance. Its SI unit is ohm-1
or siemens.
It can be defined as the ratio of rms

Phasor diagram:

Fig. 13.12: Series LCR circuit.

Let a pure resistor R, a pure inductance
L and an ideal capacitor of capactance C be
connected in series to a source of alternative
emf. As R, L and C are in series, the current
at any instant through the three elements
has the same amplitude and phase. Let it be
represented by
i = i0 sin ω t.
The voltage across each element bears a
different phase relationship with the current.
The voltages eL, eC and eR are given by
eR = iR, eL = iXL and eC = iXC
As the voltage across the capacitor lags
behind the alternating
current by 90°, it is

From the phasor diagram (Fig. 13.13) it can
be seen that in an AC circuit containing L, C

∴ The alternating current in LCR circuit
would be represented by

We can now discuss three cases based on
the above discussion.
(i) When XL = XC then tan φ = 0.
		 Hence voltage and current are in phase.
Thus the AC circuit is non inductive.
(ii) When XL > XC, tan φ is positive ∴ φ is
positive.
		 Hence voltage leads the current by a phase

(iii) When XL < XC, tan φ is negative ∴ φ is

13.6 Power in AC circuit:
We know that power is defined as the
rate of doing work. For a DC circuit, power is
measured as a product of voltage and current.
But since in an AC circuit the values of current
and voltage change at every instant the power
in an AC circuit at a given instant is the product
of instantaneous voltage and instantaneous
current.
a) Average power associated with resistance
(power in AC circuit with resistance).
In a pure resistor, the alternating current
developed is in phase with the alternating
voltage applied i.e. when e = e0 sin ω t
then i = i0 sin ω t
Now instantaneous power P = ei.
P = (e0 sin ω t) (i0 sin ω t )
= e0 i0 sin2 ω t 		
--- (13.14)
The instantaneous power varies with
time, hence we consider the average power for
a complete cycle by integrating Eq. (13.14).

∴Current through pure inductor or ideal
capacitor which consumes no power for
its maintenance, in the circuit is called idle
current or wattless current. Power dissipated
in a circuit is due to resistance only.

charged capacitor is connected to an inductor,
the charge is transferred to the inductor and
current starts flowing through the inductor.
Because of the increasing current there will be
a change in the magnetic flux of the inductor
in the circuit. Hence induced emf is produced
in the circuit. This self- induced emf will try
to oppose the growth of the current. Due to this
the charge (energy stored in) on the capacitor
decreases and an equivalent amount of energy
is stored in the inductor in the form of magnetic
field. When the discharging of the capacitor
completes, all the energy stored in the capacitor
will be stored in the inductor. The capacitor
will become fully discharged whereas inductor
will be storing all the energy. As a result now
the inductor will start charging the capacitor.
The current and magnetic flux linked with
the inductor starts decreasing. Therefore an
induced emf is produced which recharges the
capacitor in the opposite direction. This process
of charging and discharging of capacitor is
repeated and energy taken from the source
keeps on oscillating between the capacitor (C)
and the inductor (L).
When a charged capacitor is allowed to
discharge through a non-resistive inductor,
electrical oscillations of constant amplitude
and frequency are produced. These oscillations
are called LC oscillations. This is explaind in
Fig. 13. 16.

repeats itself in the opposite direction.
The circuit eventually returns to the initial
state.
Thus the energy of the system continuously
surges back and forth between the electric
field of the capacitor and magnetic field of the
inductor. This produces electrical oscillations
of a definite frequency . These are called LC
Oscillations. If there is no loss of energy the
amplitude of the oscillations remain constant
and the oscillations are undamped.
However LC oscillations are usually
damped due to following reasons.
1. Every inductor has some resistance. This
causes energy loss as heat. The amplitude
of oscillations goes on decreasing and they
finally die out.
2. Even if the resistance were zero, total
energy of the system would not remain
constant. It is radiated away in the form
of electromagnetic waves. Working of
radio and TV transmitters is based on such
radiations.
13.8 Electric Resonance:
Have you ever wondered how radio
picks certain frequencies so you can play
your favourite channel or why does a glass
break down in an orchestra concert? Why do
you think you encounter such situations? The
answer lies in the phenomenon of resonance.
The phenomenon of resonance can be observed
in systems that have a tendency to oscillate
at a particular frequency, which is called
the natural frequency of oscillation of the
system. When such a system is driven by an
energy source, whose frequency is equal to the
natural frequency of the system, the amplitude

circuit is closed, the
capacitor begins to
discharge itself through
the inductor giving rise
to a current (I) in the
circuit. As the current (I)
increases, it builds up a magnetic field around
the inductor. A part of the electrical energy of
the capacitor gets stored in the inductor in the
1 2
form of magnetic energy U B = LI
2
Fig. 13.16 (c) At
a later instant the
capacitor
gets
fully
discharged
and the potential
difference
across
its plates becomes
zero. The current reaches its maximum value
I 0, the energy in the magnetic field is energy
1 2
LI 0 . Thus the entire electrostatic energy
2
of the capacitor has been converted into the
magnetic field energy of the inductor.
Fig. 13. 16 (d) After
the discharge of the
capacitor is complete, the
magnetic flux linked with
the inductor decreases
inducing a current in the
same direction (Lenz’s
Law) as the earlier current. The current thus
persists but with decreasing magnitude and
charges the capacitor in the opposite direction.
The magnetic energy of the inductor begins
to change into the electrostatic energy of the
capacitor.
Fig. 13.16 (e)
The
process continues till the
capacitor is fully charged
with a polarity which
is opposite to that in its
initial state. Thus the

At ω= ωr, value of peak current (i0) is maximum.
The maximum value of peak current is
e
inversely proportional to R (i0 =  0 ) . For
R
lower R values, i0 is large and vice versa. The
variation of rms current with frequency of AC
is as shown in graph 13.18. The curve is called
the series resonance curve. At resonance rms
current becomes maximum. This circuit at
resonant condition is very useful for radio
and TV receivers for tuning the signal from a
desired transmitting station or channel.

of oscillations become large and resonance is
said to occur.
(a) Series resonance circuit:

Fig. 13.17: Series resonance circuit.

A circuit in which inductance L, capacitance
C and resistance R are connected in series
(Fig. 13.17), and the circuit admits maximum
current corresponding to a given frequency of
AC, is called a series resonance circuit.

4) Current has a maximum value.
5) When a number of frequencies are fed to
it, it accepts only one frequency (fr) and
rejects the other frequencies. The current
is maximum for this frequency. Hence it is
called acceptor circuit.

capacity C joined in parallel to a source of
alternating emf. as shown in Fig. 13.19.

Where f r is called the resonant frequency.
At this particular frequency fr , since XL = XC
we get Z= R 2 + 0 = R. This is the least value

Do you know?
Resonance occurs in a series LCR circuit

when XL = XC or  
. For resonance
LC
to occur, the presence of both L and C
elements in the circuit is essential. Only
then the voltages L and C (being 180° out
of phase) will cancel each other and current
amplitude will be e0/R i.e., the total source
voltage will appear across. So we cannot
have resonance LR and CR circuit.

Where f r is called the resonant frequency.
Therefore at parallel resonance frequency
f r , i = minimum i.e. the circuit allows
minimum current to flow through it. (as shown
in the graph 13.20). Impedance is maximum
at this frequency. The circuit is called parallel
resonance circuit . A parallel resonant circuit
is very useful in wireless transmission or radio
communication and filter circuits.

the power dissipated by the circuit becomes

Do you know?
The tuning circuit of a radio or TV is an
example of LCR resonant circuit. Signals
are transmitted by different stations at
different frequencies which are picked up
by the antenna. Corresponding to these
frequencies a number of voltages appear
across the series LCR circuit. But maximum
current flows through the circuit for that
AC voltage which has frequency equal to
1
fr =
. If Q-value of the circuit is
2 LC 
large, the signals of the other stations will
be very weak. By changing the value of the
adjustable capacitor C, the signal from the
desired station can be tuned in.

Fig. 13.21: Sharpness resonance.

From the curve in the Fig. (13.21) we
see that there are two such values of ω say
ω 1 and ω 2 , one greater and other smaller than
ω r and symmetrical about ω r such that
		 ω 1 = ω r + Δ ω
		 ω 2 = ω r – Δ ω
The difference ω 1 – ω 2 = 2Δ ω is called the

bandwidth of the circuit. The quantity ( r )
2
is regarded as the measure of the sharpness
of resonance. The sharpness of resonance is
measured by a coefficient called the quality or
Q factor of the circuit
The Q factor of a series resonant circuit is
defined as the ratio of the resonant frequency to
the difference in two frequencies taken on both
sides of the resonant frequency such that at
each frequency the current amplitude becomes
1
times the value at resonant frequency.

13.10 Choke Coil:
If we use a resistance to reduce the current
passing through an AC circuit, there will
be loss of electric energy in the form of heat
(I2 RT) due to Joule heating. A choke coil helps
to minimise this effect.
A choke coil is an inductor, used to reduce
AC passing through a circuit without much
loss of energy. It is made up of thick insulated
copper wires wound closely in a large number
of turns over a soft iron laminated core. Choke
coil offers large resistance X L = ω L to the
flow of AC and hence current is reduced.
Laminated core reduces eddy current loss.
Average power dissipated in the choke
is P = I rms Erms cos φ , where the power factor
R
cos φ =
.
2
R   2 L2
For a choke coil, L is very large. Hence R
is very small so cos φ is nearly zero and power
loss is very small. The only loss of energy is
due hysteresis loss in the iron core, which can
be reduced using a soft iron core.

Q-factor is a dimensionless quantity. The
larger the value of Q-factor, the smaller the
value of 2 or the bandwidth and sharper
is the peak in the current or the series resonant
circuit is more selective.
Fig. (13.21) shows that the lower angular
frequency side of the resonance curve is
dominated by the capacitor’s reactance, the
high angular frequency side is dominated by
the inductor’s reactance and resonance occurs
in the middle.

14. Dual Nature of Radiation and Matter
like tiny oscillators that emit electromagnetic
radiation only in discrete packets (E = nhν),
where ν is the frequency of oscillator. The
emissions occur only when the oscillator makes
a jump from one quantized level of energy to
another of lower energy. This model of Planck
turned out to be the basis for Einstein’s theory
to explain the observations of experiments on
photoelectric effect which we will study in the
following section.
14.2 The Photoelectric Effect:
Heinrich Hertz discovered photoelectric
emission in 1887 while he was working on the
production of electromagnetic waves by spark
discharge. He noticed that when ultraviolet
light is incident on a metal electrode, a high
voltage spark passes across the electrodes.
Actually electrons were emitted from the metal
surface. The surface which emits electrons,
when illuminated with appropriate radiation,
is known as a photosensitive surface.

Can you recall?
1. What is electromagnetic radiation?
2. What are the characteristics of a wave?
3. What do you mean by frequency and
wave number associated with a wave?
4. What are the characteristic properties
of particles of matter?
5. How do we define momentum of a
particle?
6. What are the different types of energies
that a particle of matter can possess?
14.1 Introduction:
In earlier chapters you have studied
various optical phenomena like reflection,
refraction, interference, diffraction and
polarization of light. Light is electromagnetic
radiation and most of the phenomena
mentioned have been explained considering
light as a wave. We are also familiar with
the wave nature of electromagnetic radiation
in other regions like X-rays, γ-rays, infrared
and ultraviolet radiation and microwaves
apart from the visible light. Electromagnetic
radiation consists of mutually perpendicular
oscillating electric and magnetic fields, both
being perpendicular to the direction in which
the wave and energy are travelling.
In Chapter 3 on Kinetic Theory of Gases
and Radiation, you have come across spectrum
of black body radiation which cannot be
explained using the wave nature of radiation.
Such phenomena appear during the interaction
of radiation with matter and need quantum
physics to explain them.
The idea of 'quantization of energy' was
first proposed by Planck to explain the black
body spectrum. Planck proposed a model that
says (i) energy is emitted in packets and (ii)
at higher frequencies, the energy of a packet
is large. Planck assumed that atoms behave

Fig. 14.1: Process of photoelectric effect.

The phenomenon of emission of electrons
from a metal surface, when radiation of
appropriate frequency is incident on it, as
shown in Fig. 14.1, is known as photoelectric
effect. For metals like zinc, cadmium,
magnesium etc., ultraviolet radiation is
necessary while for alkali metals, even visible
radiation is sufficient.
Electrical energy can be obtained from light
(electromagnetic radiation) in two ways
(i) photo-emissive effect as described above
and (ii) photo-voltaic effect, used in a solar
cell. In the latter case, an electrical potential
difference is generated in a semiconductor
using solar energy.
306

14.2.1 Experimental Set-up of Photoelectric
Effect:
A typical laboratory experimental set-up
for the photoelectric effect (Fig. 14.2) consists
of an evacuated glass tube with a quartz
window containing a photosensitive metal
plate - the emitter E and another metal plate
- the collector C. The emitter and collector
are connected to a voltage source whose
voltage can be changed and to an ammeter to
measure the current in the circuit. A potential
difference of V, as measured by the voltmeter,
is maintained between the emitter E (the
cathode) and collector C (the anode), normally
C being at a positive potential with respect to
the emitter. This potential difference can be
varied and C can even be at negative potential
with respect to E. When the anode potential V
is positive, it accelerates the electrons (hence
called accelerating potential) while when the
anode potential V is negative, it retards the
flow of electrons (therefore known as retarding
potential). A source S of monochromatic light
(light corresponding to only one specific
frequency) of sufficiently high frequency
(short wavelength ≤ 10-7 m) is used.

from the metal through its surface. These
electrons, called photoelectrons, are collected
at the collector C (photoelectron are ordinary
electrons, they are given this name to indicate
that they are emitted due to incident light). We
now know that free electrons are available in
a metal plate. They are emitted if sufficient
energy (we will know more about this energy
later in the Chapter) is supplied to them to
overcome the barrier that keeps them inside
the metal.
In the late nineteenth century, these
facts were not known and scientists working
on photoelectric effect performed various
experiments and noted down their observations.
These observations are summarized below.
We will try to analyze these observations and
their explanation.
14.2.2 Observations from Experiments on
Photoelectric Effect:
1. When ultraviolet radiation was incident on
the emitter plate, current I was recorded
even if the intensity of radiation was very
low. Photocurrent I was observed only
if the frequency of the incident radiation
was more than some threshold frequency
ν0. ν0 was same for a given metal and was
different for different metals used as the
emitter. For a given frequency ν ( > ν0) of
the incident radiation, no matter how feeble
was the light meaning however small the
intensity of radiation be, electrons were
always emitted.
2. There was no time lag between the
incidence of light and emission of electrons.
The photocurrent started instantaneously
(within 10-9 s) on shining the radiation even
if the intensity of radiation was low. As
soon as the incident radiation was stopped,
the flow of current stopped.
3. Keeping the frequency ν of the incident
radiation and accelerating potential V
fixed, if the intensity was increased, the
photo current increased linearly with
intensity as shown in Fig. 14.3.

Fig. 14.2: Schematic of experimental set-up for
photoelectric effect.

Light is made to fall on the surface of
the metal plate E and electrons are ejected
307

the frequency of the incident radiation is
changed, KEmax changed. It did not depend
on the intensity of the incident radiation.
Thus, even for very small incident intensity,
if the frequency of incident radiation was
larger than the threshold frequency v0,
KEmax from a given surface was always the
same for a given incident frequency.
7. If increasingly negative potentials were
applied to the collector, the photocurrent
decreased and for some typical value -V0,
photocurrent became zero. V0 was termed
as cut-off or stopping potential. It indicated
that when the potential was retarding, the
photoelectrons still had enough energy to
overcome the retarding (opposing) electric
field and reach the collector. Value of V0
was same for any incident intensity as long
as the incident frequency was same (Fig.
14.4) but was different for different emitter
materials.
8. If the frequency of incident radiation
was changed keeping the intensity and
accelerating potential V constant, then the
saturation current remained the same but
the stopping potential V0 changed. This
observation is depicted in Fig. 14.5. The
stopping potential V0 varied linearly with ν
as shown in Fig. 14.6. For different metals,
the slopes of such straight lines were the
same but the intercepts on the frequency
and stopping potential axes were different.

Fig. 14.3: Photocurrent as a function of incident
intensity for fixed incident frequency and
accelerating potential .

4. The photocurrent I could also be varied
by changing the potential of the collector
plate. I was dependent on the accelerating
potential V (potential difference between
the emitter and collector) for given incident
radiation (intensity and frequency were
fixed). Initially the current increased with
voltage but then it remained constant. This
was termed as the saturation current I0
(Fig. 14.4).

Fig. 14.4: Photocurrent as a function of
accelerating potential for fixed incident
frequency and different incident intensities.

5. Keeping the accelerating voltage and
incident frequency fixed, if the intensity
of incident radiation was increased, the
value of saturation current also increased
proportionately, e.g., if the intensity was
doubled, the saturation current was also
doubled.
6. The maximum kinetic energy KEmax (and
hence the maximum velocity) of the
electrons depended on the potential V for
a given metal used for the emitter plate
and for a given frequency of the incident
radiation. If the material is changed or

We know that metals have free electrons.
This fact makes metals good conductors of
heat and electricity. These electrons are free
to move inside the metal but are otherwise
confined inside the metal. They cannot escape
from the surface unless sufficient energy is
supplied to them. The minimum amount of
energy required to be provided to an electron
to pull it out of the metal from the surface is
called the work function of the metal and is
denoted by φ0 . Work function depends on the
properties of the metal and the nature of its
surface. Values of work function of metals are
generally expressed in a unit of energy called
the electron volt (eV).

frequency of incident radiation for emitters
made of different metals.

9. The photocurrent and hence the number of
electrons depended on the intensity but not
on the frequency of incident radiation, as
long as the incident frequency was larger
than the threshold frequency ν0 and the
potential of anode was higher than that of
cathode.
14.2.3 Failure of Wave Theory to Explain
the Observations from Experiments on
Photoelectric Effect:
Most of these observations could
not be explained by the wave theory of
electromagnetic radiation. First and foremost
was the instantaneous emission of electrons on
incidence of light. Wave picture would expect
that the metal surface will absorb the incident
energy continuously. All the electrons near the
surface will absorb energy. The metal surface
will require reasonable time (~ few minutes
to hours) to accumulate sufficient energy to
knock off electrons. Greater the intensity of
incident radiation, more will be the incident
energy, hence expected time required to knock
off the electrons will be less. For small incident
intensity, the energy incident on unit area in
unit time will be small, and will take longer to
knock off the electrons. These arguments were
contradictory to observations.
Let us try to estimate the time that will be
required for the photocurrent to start. We need
to define the term ‘work function’ of a metal
for this exercise.

You have studied ionization energy of an
atom. What is ionization energy to an atom
is the work function to a solid which is a
large collection of atoms.

by the radiation. According to the wave
theory, what will be the time required to

maximum kinetic energy did not depend
on the incident intensity but depended on
the incident frequency. According to wave
theory, frequency of incident radiation has
no role in determining the kinetic energy
of photoelectrons. Moreover, wave theory
expected photoelectrons to be emitted for any
frequency if the intensity of radiation was
large enough. But observations indicated that
for a given metal surface, some characteristic
cut-off frequency ν0 existed below which no
photoelectrons were emitted however intense
the incident radiation was and photoelectrons
were always emitted if incident frequency ν
was greater than ν0 even if the intensity was
low.
14.2.4 Einstein’s Postulate of Quantization
of Energy and the Photoelectric Equation:
Planck’s hypothesis of energy quantization
to explain the black body radiation was
extended by Einstein in 1905 to all types of
electromagnetic radiations. Einstein proposed
that under certain conditions, light behaves as
if it was a particle and its energy is released
or absorbed in bundles or quanta. He named
the quantum of energy of light as photon with
energy E = hν, where ν is the frequency of
light and h is a constant defined by Planck in
his model to explain black body radiation. It is
now known as the Planck’s constant and has a
value 6.626 × 10-34 J s.
It may be noted that the equation
E = hν 			
--- (14.1)
is a relation between a particle like property,
the energy E and a wave like property, the
frequency ν. Equation (14.1) is known as the
Einstein’s relation.
Einstein’s relation (14.1) holds good for
the entire electromagnetic spectrum. It says
that energy of electromagnetic radiation is
directly proportional to the frequency (and
is inversely proportional to the wavelength
since ν = c/λ). Hence high frequency radiation

connected in the circuit? (Given the metallic
radius of potassium atom is 230 pm and
work function of potassium is 2.3 eV.)
Solution : Given
Intensity of radiation = 0.5 × 10-4 W/m2,
Area of cathode = 5 cm2 = 5 × 10-4 m2.
Radius of potassium atom = 230 pm
= 230 × 10-12 m
Work function of potassium = 2.3 eV
= 2.3 × 1.6 ×10-19 J
The number N of electrons present on
the surface of cathode can be approximately
calculated assuming that each potassium
atom contributes one electron and the radius
of potassium atom is 230×10-12 m.
N = Area of cathode/ area covered by one
atom
= 5×10-4/(3.1415×230×10-12×230×10-12)
= 3009×1012
Incident power on the cathode is
= 0.5 × 10-4 W/m2 × 5×10-4 m2
= 2.5×10-8 W
Wave theory assumes that this power
distributed over the whole area of the
cathode is uniformly absorbed by all the
electrons. Therefore the energy absorbed by
each electron in one second is
= 2.5×10-8 W /3009×1012 ≈ 8.31×10-24 W.
Work function of potassium is
2.30 eV = 2.30 × 1.6 ×10-19 J
= 3.68 ×10-19 J.
Hence each electron will require minimum
3.68×10-19 J of energy to be knocked off
from the surface of the cathode.
The time required to accumulate this energy
will be
3.68 × 10-19 J / 8.31 × 10-24 W
= 0.443 × 105 s, which is about half a day.
Secondly, since larger incident intensity
implies larger energy, the electrons are
expected to be emitted with larger kinetic
energy. But the observation showed that the

short wavelength radiation means high energy
radiation.

You would notice that γ photons are the most
energetic photons and their energies are
~ 10-13 - 10-12 J. This is a very small amount
of energy on the human scale and therefore
we do not notice individual photons along
their passage.

3000 Å and 7000 Å respectively. (Remember
that the photon are not coloured. Colour is

λred = 7000 Å = 7000 × 10-10 m and
νFM = 98.3 MHz = 98.3 × 106 s-1
We know that energy E of electromagnetic
radiation of frequency ν is hν and if λ is the
corresponding wavelength, then λν = c, c

This is very small energy as compared
to the photon energy in the visible range.

•

The explanation using Einstein's postulate
of quantization of energy for the observations
mentioned in section 14.2.2 is given below.
1. Einstein argued that when a photon of
ultraviolet radiation arrives at the metal
surface and collides with an electron, it
gives all of its energy hν to the electron.
The energy is gained by the electron and
the photon no longer exists. If φ0 is the
work function of the material of the emitter
plate, then electrons will be emitted if and
only if the energy gained by the electrons
is more than or equal to the work function
i.e.,hν ≥ φ0 . Thus, a minimum or threshold
frequency ν0 (= φ0 /h) is required to eject
electrons from the metal surface. If ν < ν0,
the photon will not have enough energy
to liberate an electron. As a result, no
electron will be ejected however intense
the incident radiation is. Similarly if
ν > ν0, the energy will always be sufficient
to eject an electron, however small the
incident intensity is.
2. Energy is given by the photon to the
electron as soon as the radiation is
incident on the surface. The exchange of
energy between the photon and electron

Wavelength (in Å) × energy (in eV) ≈
12500 (numerically)
Wavelength (in nm) × energy (in eV) ≈
1250 (numerically)
311

6. If the frequency of incident radiation is
more than the threshold frequency, then
the energy φ0 is used by the electron
to escape from the metal surface and
remaining energy of the photon becomes
the kinetic energy of the electron.
Depending on the energy of the electron
inside the metal and other processes like
collisions after emission from the surface,
the maximum kinetic energy is equal to
(hν - φ0 ). Hence,
			 KEmax = hν - φ0 		
--- (14.2)
		 Equation (14.2) is known as Einstein’s
photoelectric equation. KEmax depends
on the material of the emitter plate and
varies linearly with the incident frequency
ν; it is independent of the intensity of the
incident radiation.
7. The electrons that are emitted from the
metal surface have different kinetic
energies. The reasons for this are manyfold: all the electrons in a solid do not
possess the same energy, the electrons
may be ejected from varying depths
inside the metal surface, electrons may
suffer collisions before they come out
of the metal surface and may lose their
energy etc. If V is the potential difference
between the emitter and collector and
the collector is at a lower potential,
an electron will lose its kinetic energy
in overcoming the retarding force. If
the kinetic energy is not sufficient, the
emitted electrons may not reach the
collector and the photocurrent will be
zero. If KEmax is the energy of the most
energetic electron at the emitter surface
(where its potential energy is zero) and
-V0 is the stopping potential, then this
electron will fail to reach the collector
if KEmax< eV0, where e is the electron
charge and eV0 is the energy needed for
the electron to overcome the retarding
potential V0. If the electron just fails to

is instantaneous. Hence there is no time
lag between the incidence of light and
emission of electrons. Also when the
incident radiation is stopped, there are
no photons to transfer the energy to
electrons, hence the photoemission stops
immediately.
3. According to Einstein’s proposition, if the
intensity of incident radiation for a given
wavelength is increased, there will be an
increase in the number of energy quanta
(photons) incident on unit area in unit
time; the energy of each quantum being
the same (= hν = hc/λ). Therefore larger
intensity radiation will knock off more
number of electrons from the surface and
hence the current will be larger (if ν > ν0).
Conversely lower intensity implies less
number of incident photons, hence, less
number of ejected electrons and therefore
lower current.
4. Once the electron is emitted from the
surface, if the collector is at a higher
potential than the emitter, the electric
field will accelerate the electrons towards
the collector. Higher is the accelerating
potential, more will be number of
electrons reaching the collector. Hence
the photocurrent I increases with the
accelerating potential initially. Moreover,
since the intensity of incident radiation
determines the number of photons incident
on the metal surface on unit area in unit
time, it determines the maximum number
of electrons that can be knocked off by
the incident radiation. Hence for a given
intensity, increasing the accelerating
potential can increase the current only
till all the knocked off electrons have
reached the collector. No increase can be
seen in the current beyond this limit. This
explains the saturation current I0.
5. Increasing the incident intensity will
increase the number of incident photons
and eventually the saturation current.

was accepted. The work function values φ0
for some metals were also confirmed from
Eq. (14.3). Einstein and Millikan received
Nobel prizes for their respective discoveries in
1921 and 1923 respectively.

reach the collector, i.e., it has lost all
its kinetic energy just at the collector,
KEmax= eV0 and the photocurrent becomes
zero. Equation (14.2) then explains that
stopping potential V0 depends on the
incident frequency and the material of
the emitter and does not depend on the
incident intensity.
8. If the ejected electrons have kinetic
energy more than eV0, electrons can reach
the collector, hence current flows. When
the kinetic energy of the electron is less
than or equal to eV0, no current will flow.
Photocurrent will become zero when
KEmax = eV0. Using KEmax = eV0, we can
write Eq. (14.2) as

Above equation tells us that V0 varies
linearly with incident frequency ν, and
the slope of the straight line depends on
constants h and e while the intercept of
the line depends on the material through
φ0 . Thus the slope of lines in Fig. 14.6 is
same and is independent of the material
of the emitter but intercepts are different
for different materials.
9. All the above arguments thus bring out the
fact that the magnitude of photocurrent
depends on the incident intensity through
the number of emitted photoelectrons and
the potential V of the collector but not on
the incident frequency ν as long as ν > ν0.
Thus all the observations related to the
experiments on photoelectric effect were
explained by Einstein’s hypothesis of existence
of a photon or treating light as bundles of
energy. Although Einstein gave his hypothesis
in 1905, it was not widely accepted by the
scientific community. In 1909, when Millikan
measured the charge of an electron and the
value of h, calculated from Eq. (14.3), matched
with the value given by Planck, the hypothesis

According to Einstein, energy of radiation
of frequency ν comes in bundles with
magnitude hν. Thus energy of a light beam
having n photons will be nhν, where n can take
only integral values. Is it then possible to vary
the incident energy continuously? Why we do
not see individual photons? To understand this
issue, let us consider the following example.
Example 14.3: The wavelength and
intensity of the incident light is 4000 Å and
0.1 W respectively. What is the minimum
change in the light energy? What is the
number of incident photons?

Radiation:
In its interaction with matter, light behaves
as if it is made up of packets of energy called
quanta. Later it was confirmed from other
theoretical and experimental investigations
that these light quanta can have associated

Photon picture
Only one photon is needed to eject
one electron from the metal surface
and energy exchange between
electron and photon is instantaneous
on collision.
Low intensity of incident light means
less number of photons and not low
energy photons. Hence low current
will be produced.
Higher intensity means more number
of photons incident in unit time,
therefore more number of electrons
are emitted in unit time and hence
photocurrent is larger.
Higher intensity means higher
number of incident photons per unit
time. Energy of photon is same as it
does not depend on the intensity.
A photon of low frequency light will
not have sufficient energy to release
an electron from the surface.
Increasing the frequency increases
the energy of the photon. Therefore
electrons receive more energy which
results in increasing the maximum

momentum. Hence the question came up
whether a particle can be associated with
light or electromagnetic radiation in general.

1924 in experiments on scattering of X-rays
due to electrons of matter. Summary of these
results is given in the box below and you can

where θ is the scattering angle. The shift
depends only on the scattering angle and
not on the incident wavelength. This shift
cannot be explained using wave theory. If
we let the Planck’s constant go to zero, we
get the result expected from wave theory.
This is the test to check whether the new
picture is correct or not.
Compton showed that photon has an
associated momentum along with the energy
it carries. All photons of electromagnetic
radiation of a particular frequency have the
same energy and momentum. Photons are
electrically neutral and are not deflected by
electric or magnetic fields. Photons can have
particle-like collisions with other particles
such as electrons. In photon – particle
collision, energy and momentum of the system
are conserved but the number of photons is not
conserved. Photons can be absorbed or new
photons can be created. Photons can transfer
their energy and momentum during collisions
with particles and disappear. When we turn on
light, they are created. Photon always moves
with the speed of light, it is never at rest.
Mass of a photon is not defined as we do for a
particle in Newtonian mechanics. Its rest mass
is zero (in all frames of reference).
Effects of wave nature of light were seen
in experiments on interference or diffraction
when the slit widths or the separation between
two slits are smaller than or comparable to
the wavelength of light. If the slit width is
large or the spacing between slits is more, the
interference or diffraction patterns will not
be same and the wave nature will not be so
obvious.
It was realized by scientists that some
phenomena observed in experiments in the
laboratory or in nature (like interference and

The particle nature of radiation is seen
in black body radiation and photoelectric
effect. In the former, near room temperature,
the radiation is mostly in the infrared region
while in the latter it is in the visible and
ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The
third experiment, which established that a
photon possesses momentum like a particle,
was Compton scattering where X-rays and
γ-rays interact with matter. In 1923, A. H.
Compton made a monochromatic beam
of X-rays, of wavelength λ, incident on a
graphite sheet and measured the intensity
of the scattered rays in different directions
as a function of wavelength. He found that
although the incident beam consisted of a
single wavelength λ, the scattered intensity
was maximum at two wavelengths. One of
these was same as the incident wavelength
but the other λ′ was larger by an amount
∆λ. ∆λ is known as the Compton shift that
depends on the scattering angle.
Compton explained his observations
by considering incidence of X-ray beam
on graphite as collision of X-ray photons
with the electrons of graphite, like collision
of billiard balls. Energy and momentum
is transferred during the collision and
scattered photons have lower energy than
the incident photons. Therefore they have
lower frequency or higher wavelength. The

diffraction) can be explained by considering
light in particular, and electromagnetic
radiation in general, as a wave. On the
other hand, some other observations (like
photoelectric effect and black body radiation)
can be explained only if we consider
electromagnetic radiation as consisting of
photons with definite quantum of energy
(and momentum as evident from Compton
scattering experiments). Also there are some
phenomena which can be explained by both
the theories. It is therefore essential to consider
that both the characters or behaviours hold
good; one dominates in some situations and
the other works in rest of the situations. It is
necessary to keep both the physical models to
explain the careful experimental observations.
There is thus a need to hypothesize the dual
character of light. Later it turned out that such
a picture is required not only for light but for
the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This
phenomenon is termed as wave-particle
duality of electromagnetic radiation.
14.4 Photo Cell:
Photo cell is a device that makes use
of the photoelectric effect and converts light
energy into electrical energy. Schematic of a
photocell is shown in Fig. 14.7. It consists of a
semi-cylindrical photosensitive metal plate E
(acting as a cathode) and a wire loop collector
C (acting as an anode) supported in an
evacuated glass or quartz bulb. The electrodes
are connected to an external circuit having a
high tension battery B and a microammeter
μA. Instead of a photosensitive metal plate,
the photosensitive material can be pasted in
the form of a thin film on the inner walls of the
glass bulb.
When light of suitable wavelength falls on
the cathode, photoelectrons are emitted. These
electrons are attracted towards the anode due
to the applied electric field. The generated
photocurrent is noted from the microammeter.
Photocell is used to operate control systems
and in light measuring devices. Light meters in

Fig. 14.7 : Schematic of a photocell.

Suppose source of ultraviolet radiation
is kept near the passage or entrance of a
mall or house and the light is made incident
on the cathode of a photocell, photocurrent is
generated. When a person passes through the
passage or comes near the entrance, incident
light beam is interrupted and photocurrent
stops. This event can be used to operate a
counter in counting devices, or to set a burglar
alarm. Such an arrangement can be used to
identify traffic law defaulters by setting an
alarm using the photocell.

14.5 De Broglie Hypothesis:
In 1924, Prince Louis de Broglie
(pronounced as ‘de broy’) proposed, on the
basis of the symmetry existing in nature, that
if radiation has dual nature - sometimes wave
nature dominates and sometimes particle
nature, matter may also possess dual nature.
Normally we talk about matter as composed
of particles, but are there situations where
matter seems to show wave-like properties?
This will become evident from the experiments
on diffraction of electrons from nickel crystals
described later in this chapter.
De Broglie used the properties, frequency
ν and wavelength λ, of a wave and proposed
a relation to connect these with the particle
316

properties, energy E and momentum p. The
momentum p carried by a photon of energy E
is given by the relation
E
p = 			--- (14.4)
c
which is valid for a massless particle
travelling with the speed of light c according
to Einstein's special theory of relativity. Using
the Einstein’s relation for E,
h

c
c
where λ, the wavelength, is given by λν = c.
De Broglie proposed that a moving
material particle of total energy E and
momentum p has associated with it a wave
analogous to a photon. He then suggested that
the wave and particle properties of matter
can also be described by a relation similar
to Eq. (14.5) for a photon. Thus frequency
and wavelength of a wave associated with a
material particle, of mass m moving with a
velocity v, are given as
ν = E/h and
λ = h/p = h/mv 		
--- (14.6)
He referred to these waves associated
with material particles as matter waves.
The wavelength of the matter waves, given
by Eq. (14.6), is now known as de Broglie
wavelength. Greater is the momentum, shorter
is the wavelength. Equation (14.6) for the
wavelength of matter waves is known as de
Broglie relation.

such an equation will not be applicable. You

(particles associated with electromagnetic
waves) was postulated, it was also
experimentally found that electrons sub-atomic

experiment, electrons were used in place of
light waves. Scattered electrons were detected
by an electron detector and the current was
measured with the help of a galvanometer. By
moving the detector on a circular scale that
is by changing the scattering angle θ (angle
between the incident and the scattered electron
beams), the intensity of the scattered electron
beam was measured for different values of
scattering angle. Scattered intensity was not
found to be uniform in all directions (as predicted
by classical theory). The intensity pattern
resembled a diffraction pattern with peaks
corresponding to constructive interference and
troughs to regions of destructive interference.
Diffraction is a property of waves. Hence,
above observations implied that the electrons
formed a diffraction pattern on scattering and
that particles could show wave-like properties.

also exhibit wave properties. The wavelength
associated with an electron of energy few eV
is of the order of few Å. Therefore to observe
the wave nature of electron, slit width or
diffracting objects should be of same order of
magnitude (few Å).
The wave property of electron was
confirmed experimentally in 1927 by Davisson
and Germer in America and in 1928 by George
P. Thomson in England by diffraction of
electrons by atoms in metals. Knowing that the
size of the atoms and their spacing in crystals
is of the order of few Å, they anticipated that
if electrons are scattered by atoms in a crystal,
the associated matter waves will interfere and
will show diffraction effects. It turned out to
be true in their experiments. Electrons showed
constructive and destructive interference. No
electrons were found in certain directions
due to destructive interference while in other
directions, maximum numbers of electrons
were seen due to constructive interference.
Louis de Broglie received the Nobel prize
in Physics in 1929 and Davisson, Germer and
Thomson shared the Nobel prize in Physics in
1937. It was amazing that Sir J. J. Thomson
discovered the existence of electron as a subatomic particle while his son G. P. Thomson
showed that electron behaves like a wave.
14.6 Davisson and Germer Experiment:
A schematic of the experimental
arrangement of the Davisson and Germer
experiment is shown in Fig. 14.8. The whole
set-up is enclosed in an evacuated chamber.
It uses an electron gun - a device to produce
electrons by heating a tungsten filament F
using a battery B. Electrons from the gun
are accelerated through vacuum to a desired
velocity by applying suitable accelerating
potential across a cylindrical anode and are
collimated into a focused beam. This beam
of electrons falls on a nickel crystal and is
scattered in different directions by the atoms of
the crystal. Thus, in the Davisson and Germer

Fig. 14.8: Schematic of Davisson and Germer
experiment.

Davisson and Germer varied the
accelerating potential from 44 V to 68 V
and observed a peak in the intensity of the
scattered electrons at scattering angle of 50º
for a potential of 54 V. This peak was the result
of constructive interference of the electrons
scattered from different layers of the regularly
spaced atoms of the nickel crystal.
From Eq. (14.7), for V = 54 V, we get
λ = 1.228/√54 = 0.167 nm --- (14.8)
From
the
electron
diffraction
measurements, the wavelength of matter
waves associated with the electrons was
found to be 0.165 nm. The two values of λ,

obtained from the experimental results and
from the theoretical de Broglie relation, were
in close agreement. The Davisson and Germer
experiment thus substantiated de Broglie’s
hypothesis of wave-particle duality and
verified his relation.

particles. Wave-particle duality implies that all
moving particles have an associated frequency
and an associated wave number and all waves
have an associated energy and an associated
momentum. We come across the wave-particle
duality of matter due to quantum behaviour
when we are dealing with microscopic objects
(sizes ≤ 10-6 m). Small order of magnitude of
h sets the scale at which quantum phenomena
manifest themselves.
If all the material objects in motion have
an associated wavelength (and therefore an
associated wave), why then we do not talk
about wavelength of a child running with speed
v on a pathway 2 m wide or a car moving with
speed v on a road 20 m wide? To understand
this, let us try to calculate these quantities.

Use your brain power
Diffraction results described above
can be produced in the laboratory using
an electron diffraction tube as shown in
figure. It has a filament which on heating
produces electrons. This filament acts as a
cathode. Electrons are accelerated to quite
high speeds by creating large potential
difference between the cathode and a
positive electrode. On its way, the beam
of electrons comes across a thin sheet of

Example 14.5: A student, weighing 45 kg,
is running with a speed of 8 km per hr on a
foot path 2 m wide. A small car, weighing
1200 kg, is moving with a speed of 60 km
per hr on a 20 m wide road. Calculate their
de Broglie wavelengths.
Solution : Given
v1 = 8 km / hr = 8 × 103 /3600 m / s and
m1 = 45 kg for the student,
v2 = 60 km / hr = 60 × 103 /3600 m / s and
m2 = 1200 kg for the car,
momentum p1 = 45 × 8 × 103 /3600
= 100 kg m /s for the student and
momentum p2 = 1200 × 60 × 103 /3600
= 20000 kg m /s for the car.
The de Broglie wavelength
λ1 = h/p1 = 6.63 × 10-34 J s / 100 kg m /s
= 6.63 × 10-36 m. for the student, and

= 3.32 × 10-38 m for the car.

graphite. The electrons are diffracted by
the atomic layers in the graphite and form
diffraction rings on the phosphor screen. By
changing the voltage between the cathode
and anode, the energy, and therefore the
speed, of the electrons can be changed. This
will change the wavelength of the electrons
and a change will be seen in the diffraction
pattern. By increasing the voltage, the
radius of the diffraction rings will
decrease. Try to explain why?
14.7 Wave-Particle Duality of Matter:
Material particles show wave-like nature
under certain circumstances. This phenomenon
is known as wave-particle duality of matter.
Frequency ω and wave number k are used
to describe waves in classical theories while
mass m and momentum p are used to describe

The wavelengths calculated in example
14.5 are negligible compared to the size of
the moving objects as well as to the widths
of the paths on which the objects are moving.
319

Therefore the wavelengths associated with
macroscopic particles do not play any
significant role in our everyday life and we
need not consider their wave nature. Also the
wavelengths for macroscopic particles are so
small that they cannot be measured.
On the other hand, if we try to estimate the
associated de Broglie wavelength of a moving
electron passing through a small aperture of
size 10-10 m or an oxygen molecule in air, we
will find it to be significant as can be seen in
the following example.

obstacles, or are not measurable, we can use
Newtonian mechanics.
In conclusion, for both electromagnetic
radiation and atomic and sub-atomic particles,
particle nature is dominant during their
interaction with matter. On the other hand,
while traveling through space, particularly
when their confinement is of same order of
magnitude as their associated wavelength, the
wave nature is dominant.

Example 14.6: Calculate the de Broglie
wavelength of an electron moving with
kinetic energy of 100 eV passing through a
circular hole of diameter 2 Å.
Solution: Given
EK = 100 eV = 100 × 1.6 × 10-19 J.
The speed of the electron is given by the
1
relation
mv2 = 100 × 1.6 × 10-19 J.

= 0.593 × 107 m/s and
momentum p = 9.11 × 10-31 kg ×
0.593 × 107 m/s = 5.40 × 10-24 kg m/s
∴ the de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p
= 6.63 × 10-34 J s / 5.40 × 10-24 kg m/s
= 1.23 × 10-10 m = 1.23 Å.
The wavelength of the electron in above
example is comparable to the size of the hole
through which the electron is passing. The
wavelength associated with this electron is
same as the size of a helium atom and more
than double the size of a hydrogen atom.

We have seen earlier that electrons are
bound inside a metal surface and need
some minimum energy equal to the work
function to be knocked off from the surface.
This energy, if provided by any means, can
make the electron come out of the metal
surface. Physical ways to provide this
energy differentiate the physical processes
involved and accordingly different devices
and characterizing microscopes based on
them have been designed by scientists.
• Thermionic emission : By heating to
temperatures ~2000 ºC provide thermal
energy.
• Field emission : By establishing strong
electric fields ~106 V/m at the surface
of a metal tip, provide electrical energy.
• Photo-electron emission : By shining
radiation of suitable frequency
(ultraviolet or visible) on a metal
surface provide light energy.
Electron microscope:
You have learnt about resolving
power and resolution of telescopes and
microscopes that use the ordinary visible
light. The resolution of a microscope is
limited by the wavelength of the light
used. The shorter the wavelength of the
characterizing probe, the smaller is the
limit of resolution of a microscope, i.e., the
resolution of microscope is better. Better

resolution can be attained by illuminating
the objects to be seen by radiation of smaller
wavelengths. We have seen that an electron
can behave as a wave and its wavelength is
much smaller than the wavelength of visible
light. The wavelength can be made much
smaller as it depends on the velocity and
kinetic energy of the electron. An electron
beam accelerated to several keV of energy
will correspond to de Broglie wavelength
much smaller than an angstrom, i.e.,
λe<< 1×10-10 m. The resolution of this
electron microscope will be several hundred
times higher than that obtainable with an
optical microscope.
Other
advantages
of
electron
microscopes are that (i) electrons do not
penetrate the matter as visible light or
X-rays do, (ii) electron beams can be more
easily produced and controlled by electric
and magnetic fields than electromagnetic
waves and (iii) electrons can be focused
like light is focused with lenses.
It was proposed in 1925 that atoms in
the solids can act as diffraction centers for
electron waves and can give information
about the geometry or structure of solid,
just as X-rays do on getting diffracted by
solids. However, it took many years to
realize an electron microscope for practical
applications. The first electron microscope
was developed by Herald Ruska in Berlin,
Germany in the year 1929.
Microscopic objects, when illuminated
using electron beams, yield high resolution
images. Images of microscopic and
nanometric objects and even of viruses
have been obtained by scientists using
electron microscopes, making valuable
contributions to mankind.

15. Structure of Atoms and Nuclei
was applied between two electrodes inside
an evacuated tube. The cathode was seen to
emit rays which produced a glow when they
struck the glass behind the anode. By studying
the properties of these rays, he concluded that
the rays are made up of negatively charged
particles which he called electrons. This
demonstrated that atoms are not indestructible.
They contain electrons which are emitted by
the cathode.
Thomson proposed his model of an atom
in 1903. According to this model an atom is
a sphere having a uniform positive charge in
which electrons are embedded. This model is
referred to as Plum-pudding model. The total
positive charge is equal to the total negative
charge of electrons in the atom, rendering
it electrically neutral. As the whole solid
sphere is uniformly positively charged, the
positive charge cannot come out and only the
negatively charged electrons which are small,
can be emitted. The model also explained
the formation of ions and ionic compounds.
However, further experiments on structure
of atoms which are described below, showed
the distribution of charges to be very different
than what was proposed in Thomson’s model.
15.3 Geiger-Marsden Experiment:
In order to understand the structure of
atoms, Rutherford suggested an experiment for
scattering of alpha particles by atoms. Alpha
particles are helium nuclei and are positively
charged (having charge of two protons). The
experiment was performed by his colleagues
Geiger (1882-1945) and Marsden (18891970) between 1908 and 1913. A sketch of the
experimental set up is shown in Fig.15.1.
Alpha particles from a source were collimated,
i.e., focused into a narrow beam, and were
made to fall on a gold foil. The scattered
particles produced scintillations on the

What is Dalton’s atomic model?
What are atoms made of?
What is wave particle duality?
What are matter waves?

15.1. Introduction:
Greek philosophers Leucippus (-370 BC)
and Democritus (460 – 370 BC) were the first
scientists to propose, in the 5th century BC, that
matter is made of indivisible parts called atoms.
Dalton (1766-1844) gave his atomic theory
in early nineteenth century. According to his
theory (i) matter is made up of indestructible
particles, (ii) atoms of a given element are
identical and (iii) atoms can combine with
other atoms to form new substances. That
atoms were indestructible was shown to be
wrong by the experiments of J. J. Thomson
(1856-1940) who discovered electrons in 1887.
He then proceeded to give his atomic model
which had some deficiencies and was later
improved upon by Ernest Rutherford (18711937) and Niels Bohr (1885-1962). We will
discuss these different models in this Chapter.
You have already studied about atoms and
nuclei in XIth Std. in chemistry. This chapter
will enable you to consolidate your concepts
in this subject.
We will learn that, an atom contains
a tiny nucleus whose size (radius) is about
100000 times smaller than the size of an atom.
The nucleus contains all the positive charge
of the atom and also 99.9% of its mass. In
this Chapter we will also study properties of
the nucleus, the forces that keep it intact, its
radioactive decays and about the energy that
can be obtained from it.
15.2. Thomson’s Atomic Model:
Thomson performed several experiments
with glass vacuum tube wherein a voltage
324

this particle was thus found to be about 10-15
times that of an atom. He called this particle
the nucleus of an atom.
He proposed that the entire positive charge
and most (99.9%) of the mass of an atom is
concentrated in the central nucleus and the
electrons revolve around it in circular orbits,
similar to the revolution of the planets around
the Sun in the Solar system. The revolution of
the electrons was necessary as without it, the
electrons would fall into the positively charged
nucleus and the atom would collapse. The
space between the orbits of the electrons (which
decide the size of the atom) and the nucleus is
mostly empty. Thus, most alpha particles pass
through this empty space undeflected and a
very few which are in direct line with the tiny
nucleus or are extremely close to it, get repelled
and get deflected through large angles. This
model also explains why no positively charged
particles are emitted by atoms while negatively
charged electrons are. This is because of the
large mass of the nucleus which does not get
affected when force is applied on the atom.
15.4.1. Difficulties with Rutherford’s Model:
Though this model in its basic form is
still accepted, it faced certain difficulties.
We know from Maxwell’s equations that an
accelerated charge emits electromagnetic
radiation. An electron in Rutherford’s model
moves uniformly along a circular orbit around
the nucleus. Even though the magnitude
of its velocity is constant, its direction
changes continuously and so the motion is an
accelerated motion. Thus, the electron should
emit electromagnetic radiation continuously.
Also, as it emits radiation, its energy would
decrease and consequently, the radius of its
orbit would decrease continuously. It would
then spiral into the nucleus, causing the atom
to collapse and lose its atomic properties. As
the electron loses energy, its velocity changes
continuously and the frequency of the radiation
emitted would also change continuously as

surrounding screen. The scintillations could be
observed through a microscope which could be
moved to cover different angles with respect
to the incident beam. It was found that most
alpha particles passed straight through the foil
while a few were deflected (scattered) through
various scattering angles. A typical scattering
angle is shown by θ in the figure. Only about
0.14% of the incident alpha particles were
scattered through angles larger than 0.1o. Even
out of these, most were deflected through very
small angles. About one alpha particle in 8000
was deflected through angle larger than 90o
and a fewer still were deflected through angles
as large as 180o.
15.4. Rutherford’s Atomic Model:
Results of Geiger-Marsden’s experiment
could not be explained by Thomson’s model. In
that model, the positive charge was uniformly
spread over the large sphere constituting the
atom. The volume density of the positive
charge would thus be very small and all of the
incident alpha particles would get deflected
only through very small angles. Rutherford
argued that the alpha particles which were
deflected back must have encountered a
massive particle with large positive charge so
that it was repelled back. From the fact that
extremely small number of alpha particles
turned back while most others passed through
almost undeflected, he concluded that the
positively charged particle in the atom must be
very small in size and must contain most of
the mass of the atom. From the experimental
data, the size of this particle was found to be
about 10 fm (femtometre, 10-15) which is about
10-5 times the size of the atom. The volume of
325

it moves towards the nucleus. None of these
things are observed. Firstly, most atoms are
very stable and secondly, they do not constantly
emit electromagnetic radiation and definitely
not of varying frequency. The atoms have to
be given energy, e.g., by heating, for them to
be able to emit radiation and even then, they
emit electromagnetic radiations of particular
frequencies as will be seen in the next section.
Rutherford’s model failed on all these counts.
15.5 Atomic Spectra:
We know that when a metallic object
is heated, it emits radiation of different
wavelengths. When this radiation is passed
through a prism, we get a continuous
spectrum. However, the case is different when
we heat hydrogen gas inside a glass tube to
high temperatures. The emitted radiation has
only a few selected wavelengths and when
passed through a prism we get what is called
a line spectrum as shown for the visible range
in Fig.15.2. It shows that hydrogen emits
radiations of wavelengths 410, 434, 486 and
656 nm and does not emit any radiation with
wavelengths in between these wavelengths.
The lines seen in the spectrum are called
emission lines.

separation between successive lines decreases
as we go towards shorter wavelength and they
reach a limiting value.
Schematic diagrams for the first three
series are shown in Fig.15.3. The limiting value
of the wavelength for each series is shown by
dotted lines in the figure.

The difference in wavelengths of

different values of n. Atoms of other elements
also emit line spectra. The wavelengths of the
lines emitted by each element are unique, so
much so that we can identify the element from
the wavelengths of the spectral lines that it
emits. Rutherford’s model could not explain
the atomic spectra.

Hydrogen atom also emits radiation
at some other values of wavelengths in the
ultraviolet (UV), the infrared (IR) and at
longer wavelengths. The spectral lines can
be divided into groups known as series with
names of the scientists who studied them. The
series, starting from shorter wavelengths and
going to larger wavelengths are called Lyman

15.6. Bohr’s Atomic Model:
Niels Bohr modified Rutherford’s model
by applying ideas of quantum physics which
were being developed at that time. He realized
that Rutherford’s model is essentially correct
and all that it needs is stability of the orbits.
Also, the electrons in these stable orbits should
not emit electromagnetic waves as required by
classical (Maxwell’s) electromagnetic theory.
He made three postulates which defined his
atomic model. These are given below.
1. The electrons revolve around the nucleus
in circular orbits.
This is the same assumption as in
Rutherford’s model and the centripetal force
necessary for the circular motion is provided
by the electrostatic force of attraction between
the electron and the nucleus.
2. The radius of the orbit of an electron can
only take certain fixed values such that the
angular momentum of the electron in these
orbits is an integral multiple of h/2π, h being
the Planck’s constant.
Such orbits are called stable orbits or
stable states of the electrons and electrons
in these orbits do not emit radiation as is
demanded by classical physics. Thus, different
orbits have different and definite values of
angular momentum and therefore, different
values of energies.
3. An electron can make a transition from
one of its orbit to another orbit having lower
energy. In doing so, it emits a photon of
energy equal to the difference in its energies
in the two orbits.
15.6.1. Radii of the Orbits:
Using first two postulates we can study
the entire dynamics of the circular motion of
the electron, including its energy. Let the mass
of the electron be me, its velocity in the nth
stable orbit be vn and the radius of its orbit be
rn. The angular momentum is then mevn­rn and
according to the second postulate above, we
can write
h
mevn rn  n
		
--- (15.2)
2

The positive integer n is called the principal
quantum number of the electron. The
centripetal force necessary for the circular
motion of the electron is provided by the
electrostatic force of attraction between the
electron and the nucleus. Assuming the atomic
number (number of electrons) of the atom to be
Z, the total positive charge on the nucleus is Ze
and we can write,

Here, ε 0 is the permeability of vacuum and e

Similarly, eliminating rn from Eq.(15.2) and
Eq.(15.3), we get,

2 0 h n
Equation (15.4) shows that the radius of
the orbit is proportional to n 2 , i.e., the
square of the principal quantum number.
The radius increases with increase in n. The
hydrogen atom has only one electron, i.e., Z
is 1. Substituting the values of the constants
h, ε0, m and e in Eq.(15.4), we get, for n = 1,
r1 = 0.053 nm. This is called the Bohr radius
2
and is denoted by a0 = h  0 .
 me e 2
This is the radius of the smallest orbit of the
electron in hydrogen atom. From Eq. (15.4),
we can write,
rn = a 0 n 2 			--- (15.6)
Example 15.1: Calculate the radius of the
3rd orbit of the electron in hydrogen atom.

rn = a 0 n 2 . Thus, the radius of the third orbit
(n = 3) is

The negative value of the energy of the
electron indicates that the electron is bound
inside the atom and it has to be given energy
so as to make the total energy zero, i.e., to
make the electron free from the nucleus. The
energy increases (becomes less negative) with
increase in n. Substituting the values of the
constants m,e,h and ε 0 in the above equation,
we get

--- (15.8)
n
The first orbit ( n = 1) which has minimum
energy, is called the ground state of the atom.
Orbits with higher values of n and therefore,
higher values of energy are called the excited
states of the atom. If the electron is in the nth
orbit, it is said to be in the nth energy state.
For hydrogen atom (Z = 1) the energy of the
electron in its ground state is -13.6 eV and the
energies of the excited states increase as given
by Eq.(15.8). The energy levels of hydrogen
atom are shown in Fig.15.4. The energies of
the levels are given in eV.

Example 15.2: In a Rutherford scattering
experiment, assume that an incident alpha
particle (radius 1.80 fm) is moving directly
toward a target gold nucleus (radius 6.23
fm). If the alpha particle stops right at the
surface of the gold nucleus, how much
energy did it have to start with?
Solution: Initially when the alpha particle
is far away from the gold nucleus, its total
energy is equal to its kinetic energy. As
it comes closer to the nucleus, more and
more of its kinetic energy gets converted to
potential energy. By the time it reaches the
surface of the nucleus, its kinetic energy is
completely converted into potential energy
and it stops moving. Thus, the initial kinetic
energy K, of the alpha particle is equal to the
potential energy when it is at the surface of
the nucleus, i.e., when the distance between
the gold nucleus and the alpha particle is
equal to the radius of the gold nucleus.

them for hydrogen atom (energy not to scale).

The energy levels come closer and closer
as n increases and their energy reaches a
limiting value of zero as n goes to infinity. The
energy required to take an electron from the
ground state to an excited state is called the
excitation energy of the electron in that state.
For hydrogen atom, the minimum excitation
energy (of n = 2 state) is -3.4-(-13.6) =10.2 eV.

In order to remove or take out the electron in
the ground state from a hydrogen atom, i.e., to
make it free (and have zero energy), we have
to supply 13.6 eV energy to it. This energy is
called the ionization energy of the hydrogen
atom. The ionization energy of an atom is
the minimum amount of energy required to
be given to an electron in the ground state
of that atom to set the electron free. It is the
binding energy of hydrogen atom. If we form
a hydrogen atom by bringing a proton and an
electron from infinity and combine them, 13.6
eV energy will be released.
According to the third postulate of Bohr,
when an electron makes a transition from mth
to nth orbit (m > n), the excess energy Em − En
is emitted in the form of a photon. The energy
of the photon which can be written as hv, v

Excitation energy of an electron in nth
orbit is the difference between its energy
in that orbit and the energy of the electron
in its ground state, i.e. -13.6 eV. Thus, the
excitation energies of the electrons in the
first two excited states are 10.2 eV and
12.09 eV respectively.

15.6.3. Limitations of Bohr’s Model:
Even though Bohr’s model seemed to
explain hydrogen spectrum, it had a few
shortcomings which are listed below.
(i) It could not explain the line spectra
of atoms other than hydrogen. Even
for hydrogen, more accurate study of
the observed spectra showed multiple
components in some lines which could not
be explained on the basis of this model.
(ii) The intensities of the emission lines
seemed to differ from line to line and
Bohr’s model had no explanation for that.
(iii) On theoretical side also the model was
not entirely satisfactory as it arbitrarily
assumed orbits following a particular
condition to be stable. There was no
theoretical basis for that assumption.
A full quantum mechanical study is
required for the complete understanding of the
structure of atoms which is beyond the scope
of this book. Some reasoning for the third
shortcoming (i.e., theoretical basis for the
second postulate in Bohr’s atomic model) was
given by de Broglie which we consider next.
15.6.4 De Broglie’s Explanation:
We have seen in Chapter 14 that material
particles also have dual nature like that for
light and there is a wave associated with every
material particle. De Broglie suggested that
instead of considering the orbiting electrons
inside atoms as particles, we should view
them as standing waves. Similar to the case
of standing waves on strings or in pipes as
studied in Chapter 6, the length of the orbit of
an electron has to be an integral multiple of its
wavelength. Thus, the length of the first orbit
will be equal to one de Broglie wavelength, λ1
of the electron in that orbit, that of the second
orbit will be twice the de Broglie wavelength
of the electron in that orbit and so on. This is
shown for the 4th orbit in Fig.(15.5)
In general, we can write,

orbit of an electron in an atom.

, which is the second

considering electrons as waves gives some
theoretical basis for the second postulate made
by Bohr.
15.7. Atomic Nucleus:
15.7.1 Constituents of a Nucleus:
The atomic nucleus is made up of
subatomic, meaning smaller than an atom,
particles called protons and neutrons.
Together, protons and neutrons are referred
to as nucleons. Mass of a proton is about
1836 times that of an electron. Mass of a
neutron is nearly same as that of a proton but
is slightly higher. The proton is a positively
charged particle. The magnitude of its charge
is equal to the magnitude of the charge of an
electron. The neutron, as the name suggests,
is electrically neutral. The number of protons
in an atom is called its atomic number and
is designated by Z. The number of electrons
330

proton and neutron, m­e , mp and mn respectively,
in this unit are:
m­e = 9.109383 × 10-31 kg
mp = 1.672623 × 10-27 kg
mn = 1.674927 × 10-27 kg
Obviously, kg is not a convenient unit
to measure masses of atoms or subatomic
particles which are extremely small compared
to one kg. Therefore, another unit called the
unified atomic mass unit (u) is used for the
purpose. One u is equal to 1/12th of the mass
of a neutral carbon atom having atomic
number 12, in its lowest electronic state. 1 u =
1.6605402 × 10-27 kg. In this unit, the masses
of the above three particles are
me = 0.00055 u
mp = 1.007825 u
mn = 1.008665 u.
The third unit for measuring masses of
atoms and subatomic particles is in terms of
the amount of energy that their masses are
equivalent to. According to Einstein’s famous
mass-energy relation, a particle having
mass m is equivalent to an amount of energy
E = mc2. The unit used to measure masses in
terms of their energy equivalent is the eV/c2.
One atomic mass unit is equal to 931.5 MeV/
c2. The masses of the three particles in this unit
are
me = 0.511 MeV/c2
mp = 938.28 MeV/c2
mn = 939.57 MeV/c2
15.7.2. Sizes of Nuclei:
The size of an atom is decided by the sizes
of the orbits of the electrons in the atom. Larger
the number of electrons in an atom, higher
are the orbits occupied by them and larger is
the size of the atom. Similarly, all nuclei do
not have the same size. Obviously, the size of
a nucleus depends on the number of nucleons
present in it, i.e., on its atomic number A. From
experimental observations it has been found that
the radius RX of a nucleus X is related to A as
1
--- (15.13)
RX = R0 A 3

in an atom is also equal to Z. Thus, the total
positive and total negative charges in an atom
are equal in magnitude and the atom as a
whole is electrically neutral. The number of
neutrons in a nucleus is written as N. The total
number of nucleons in a nucleus is called the
mass number of the atom and is designated by
A = Z + N. The mass number determines the
mass of a nucleus and of the atom. The atoms of
an element X are represented by the symbol for
the element and its atomic and mass numbers
A
as Z X . For example, symbols for hydrogen,
carbon and oxygen atoms are written as 11 H ,
12
16
6 C and 8 O . The chemical properties of an
atom are decided by the number of electrons
present in it, i.e., by Z.
The number of protons and electrons in
the atoms of a given element are fixed. For
example, hydrogen atom has one proton and
one electron, carbon atom has six protons
and six electrons. The number of neutrons in
the atoms of a given element can vary. For
example, hydrogen nucleus can have zero, one
or two neutrons. These varieties of hydrogen
are referred to as 11 H , 12 H and 13 H and are
respectively called hydrogen, deuterium and
tritium. Atoms having the same number of
protons but different number of neutrons are
called iosotopes. Thus, deuterium and tritium
are isotopes of hydrogen. They have the same
chemical properties as those of hydrogen.
Similarly, helium nucleus can have one or two
neutrons and are referred as 32 He and 42 He .
The atoms having the same mass number A,
are called isobars. Thus, 13 H and 32 He are
isobars. Atoms having the same number of
neutrons but different values of atomic number
Z, are called iosotones. Thus, 13 H and 42 He
are isotones.
Units for measuring masses of atoms and
subatomic particles
Masses of atoms and subatomic particles
are measured in three different units. First unit
is the usual unit kg. The masses of electron,

distance up to which it is effective. Over short
distances of about a few fm, the strength of the
nuclear force is much higher than that of the
other two forces. Its range is very small and
its strength goes to zero when two nucleons
are at a distance larger than a few fm. This is
in contrast to the ranges of electrostatic and
gravitational forces which are infinite.
The protons in the nucleus repel one
another due to their similar (positive) charges.
The nuclear forces between the nucleons
counter the forces of electrostatic repulsion.
As nuclear force is much stronger than the
electrostatic force for the distances between
nucleons in a typical nucleus, it overcomes
the repulsive force and keeps the nucleons
together, making the nucleus stable.
The nuclear force is not yet well
understood. What we know about its properties
can be summarized as follows.
1. It is the strongest force among subatomic
particles. Its strength is about 50-60 times
larger than that of the electrostatic force.
2. Unlike
the
electromagnetic
and
gravitational forces which act over
large distances (their range is infinity),
the nuclear force has a range of about a
few fm and the force is negligible when
two nucleons are separated by larger
distances.
3. The nuclear force is independent of the
charge of the nucleons, i.e., the nuclear
force between two neutrons with a given
separation is the same as that between
two protons or between a neutron and a
proton at the same separation.
15.8. Nuclear Binding Energy:
We have seen that in a hydrogen atom,
the energy with which the electron in its
ground state is bound to the nucleus (which is
a single proton in this case) is 13.6 eV. This is
the amount of energy which is released when
a proton and an electron are brought from
infinity to form the atom in its ground state. In
other words, this is the amount of energy which

Thus, the density of a nucleus does not
depend on the atomic number of the nucleus
and is the same for all nuclei. Substituting the
values of the constants m, π and R0 the value
of the density is obtained as 2.3 x 1017 kg m-3
which is extremely large. Among all known
elements, osmium is known to have the highest
density which is only 2.2 x 104 kg m-3. This
is smaller than the nuclear density by thirteen
orders of magnitude.

15.7.3 Nuclear Forces:
You have learnt about the four fundamental
forces that occur in nature. Out of these four,
the force that determines the structure of the
nucleus is the strong force, also called the
nuclear force. This acts between protons and
neutrons and is mostly attractive. It is different
from the electrostatic and gravitational force
in terms of its strength and range, i.e., the
332

has to be supplied to the atom to separate the
electron and the proton, i.e., to make them free.
The protons and the neutrons inside a nucleus
are also bound to one another. Energy has to
be supplied to the nucleus to make the nucleons
free, i.e., separate them and take them to large
distances from one another. This energy is the
binding energy of the nucleus. Same amount
of energy is released if we bring individual
nucleons from infinity to form the nucleus.
Where does this released energy come from?
It comes from the masses of the nucleons. The
mass of a nucleus is smaller than the total
mass of its constituent nucleons. Let the mass
of a nucleus having atomic number Z and mass
number A be M. It is smaller than the sum of
masses of Z protons and N (= A-Z) neutrons.
We can write,
 M  Z mp  N mn  M

∆ M is called the mass defect of the nucleus.
The binding energy EB , of the nucleus is given
by

EB   M c 2 = ( Z mp  N mn  M )c ---(15.15)
On the right hand side of Eq.(15.15), we can
add and subtract the mass of Z electrons which
will enable us to use atomic masses in the
calculation of binding energy. The Eq.(15.15)
thus becomes

species and therefore, compare their stabilities.
Nuclei with higher values of EB/A are more
stable as compared to nuclei having smaller
values of this quantity. Binding energy per
nucleon for different values of A (i.e., for nuclei
of different elements) are plotted in Fig.15.6.

Fig.15.6: Binding energy per nucleon as a
function of mass number.

Deuterium nucleus has the minimum
value of EB/A and is therefore, the least
stable nucleus. The value of EB/A increases
with increase in atomic number and reaches
a plateau for A between 50 to 80. Thus, the
nuclei of these elements are the most stable
among all the species. The peak occurs around
A = 56 corresponding to iron, which is thus one
of the most stable nuclei. The value of EB/A
decreases gradually for values of A greater
than 80, making the nuclei of those elements
slightly less stable. Note that the binding
energy of hydrogen nucleus having a single
proton is zero.

Here, mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom
and ZA M is the atomic mass of the element
being considered. We will be using atomic
masses in what follows, unless otherwise
specified.
An important quantity in this regard is
the binding energy per nucleon (=EB/A) of
a nucleus. This can be considered to be the
average energy which has to be supplied to
a nucleon to remove it from the nucleus and
make it free. This quantity thus, allows us
to compare the relative strengths with which
nucleons are bound in a nucleus for different

15.9 Radioactive Decays:
Many of the nuclei are stable, i.e., they can
remain unchanged for a very long time. These
have a particular ratio of the mass number and
the atomic number. Other nuclei occurring in
nature, are not so stable and undergo changes

They change or decay to other nuclei (with
different A and Z) in the process. The decaying
nucleus is called the parent nucleus while
the nucleus produced after the decay is called
the daughter nucleus. The process is called
radioactive decay or radioactivity and was
discovered by Becquerel (1852-1908) in 1876.
Radioactive decays occur because the parent
nuclei are unstable and get converted to more
stable daughter nuclei by the emission of some
particles. These decays are of three types as
described below.
Alpha Decay: In this type of decay, the parent
nucleus emits an alpha particle which is the
nucleus of helium atom. The parent nucleus
thus loses two protons and two neutrons. The
decay can be expressed as
A
A 4
--- (15.17)
Z X  Z 2 Y  
X is the parent nucleus and Y is the
daughter nucleus. All nuclei with A > 210
undergo alpha decay. The reason is that these
nuclei have a large number of protons. The
electrostatic repulsion between them is very
large and the attractive nuclear forces between
the nucleons are not able to cope with it. This
makes the nucleus unstable and it tries to
reduce the number of its protons by ejecting
them in the form of alpha particles. An
example of this is the alpha decay of bismuth
which is the parent nucleus with A = 212 and Z
= 83. The daughter nucleus has A= 208 and Z
= 81, which is thallium. The reaction is

The total mass of the products of an alpha
decay is always less than the mass of the
parent atom. The excess mass appears as the
kinetic energy of the products. The difference
in the energy equivalent of the mass of the
parent atom and that of the sum of masses of
the products is called the Q-value, Q, of the
decay and is equal to the kinetic energy of the
products. We can write,
Q = [mX – mY – mHe]c2,

Do you know?
Becquerel discovered the radioactive decay
by chance. He was studying the X-rays
emitted by naturally occurring materials
when exposed to Sunlight. He kept a
photographic plate covered in black paper,
separated from the material by a silver foil.
When the plates were developed, he found
images of the material on them, showing
that the X-rays could penetrate the black
paper and silver foil. Once while studying
uranium-potassium phosphate in a similar
way, the Sun was behind the clouds so no
exposure to Sunlight was possible. In spite
of this, he went ahead and developed the
plates and found images to have formed.
With further experimentation he concluded
that some rays were emitted by uranium
itself for which no exposure to Sunlight was
necessary. He then passed the rays through
magnetic field and found that the rays were
affected by the magnetic field. He concluded
that the rays must be charged particles and
hence were different from the X-rays.
The term radioactivity was coined by
Marie Curie who made further studies and
later discovered element radium along with
her husband. The Nobel Prize for the year
1903 was awarded jointly to Becquerel,
Marie Curie and Pierre Curie for their
contributions to radioactivity.
Beta Decay: In this type of decay the nucleus
emits an electron produced by converting a
neutron in the nucleus into a proton. Thus,
the basic process which takes place inside the
parent nucleus is
n → p + e- + antineutrino --- (15.19)
Neutrino and antineutrino are particles which
334

In beta decay also, the total mass of the
products of the decay is less than the mass of
the parent atom. The excess mass is converted
into kinetic energy of the products. The Q
value for the decay can be written as
Q = [mX – mY – me]c2
--- (15.23)
Here, we have ignored the mass of the neutrino
as it is negligible compared to the masses of
the nuclei.

Example 15.7: Calculate the energy
released in the alpha decay of 238Pu to 234U,
the masses involved being mPu = 238.04955
u, mU = 234.04095 u and mHe = 4.002603 u.
Solution: The decay can be written as 238Pu
→ 234U + 4He. Its Q value, i.e., the energy
released is given by
Q = [mPu -mU – mHe]c2
= [238.04955 - 234.04095 - 4.002603]c2 u
= 0.005997 × 931.5 MeV = 5.5862 MeV.

This is the maximum energy that the beta
particle (e+) can have, the neutrino having
zero energy in that case.

have very little mass and no charge. During beta
decay, the number of nucleons i.e., the mass
number of the nucleus remains unchanged.
The daughter nucleus has one less neutron and
one extra proton. Thus, Z increases by one and
N decreases by one, A remaining constant. The
decay can be written as,

There is another type of beta decay called
the beta plus decay in which a proton gets
converted to a neutron by emitting a positron
and a neutrino. A positron is a particle with
the same properties as an electron except
that its charge is positive. It is known as the
antiparticle of electron. This decay can be
written as,
p → n + e+ + neutrino

increases by one. The decay can be written as

An interesting thing about beta plus decay is
that the mass of a neutron is higher than the
mass of a proton. Thus the decay described by
Eq. (15.21) cannot take place for a free proton.
However, it can take place when the proton is
inside the nucleus as the extra energy needed
to produce a neutron can be obtained from the
rest of the nucleus.

Gamma Decay: In this type of decay, gamma
rays are emitted by the parent nucleus. As you
know, gamma ray is a high energy photon. The
daughter nucleus is same as the parent nucleus
as no other particle is emitted, but it has less
energy as some energy goes out in the form of
the emitted gamma ray.
We have seen that the electrons in an atom
are arranged in different energy levels (orbits)
and an electron from a higher orbit can make a
transition to the lower orbit emitting a photon
in the process. The situation in a nucleus is
similar. The nucleons occupy energy levels
with different energies. A nucleon can make a
transition from a higher energy level to a lower
energy level, emitting a photon in the process.
The difference between atomic and nuclear
energy levels is in their energies and energy
separations. Energies and the differences in the

that if we have one atom of the radioactive
material, we can never predict how long it
will take to decay. If we have N 0 number of
radioactive atoms (parent atoms or nuclei) of
a particular kind say uranium, at time t = 0, all
we can say is that their number will decrease
with time as some nuclei (we cannot say which
ones) will decay. Let us assume that at time t,
number of parent nuclei which are left is N(t).
How many of these will decay in the interval
between t and t +dt ? We can guess that the
larger the value of N(t), larger will be the
number of decays dN in time dt. Thus, we can
say that dN will be proportional to N(t). Also,
we can guess that the larger the interval dt,
larger will be the number of particles decaying
in that interval. Thus, we can write,
dN   N  t dt ,
dN   N  t  dt
or,
--- (15.24)
where, λ is a constant of proportionality
called the decay constant. The negative sign
in Eq.(15.24) indicates that the change in the
number of parent nuclei dN, is negative, i.e.,
N(t) is decreasing with time. We can integrate
this equation as

energies of different levels in an atom are of
the order of a few eVs, while those in the case
of a nucleus are of the order of a few keV to
a few MeV. Therefore, whereas the radiations
emitted by atoms are in the ultraviolet to radio
region, the radiations emitted by nuclei are in
the range of gamma rays.
Usually, the nucleons in a nucleus are
in the lowest possible energy state. They
cannot easily get excited as a large amount
of energy (in keVs or MeVs) is required for
their excitation. A nucleon however may end
up in an excited state as a result of the parent
nucleus undergoing alpha or beta decay. Thus,
gamma decays usually occur after one of these
decays. For example, 57Co undergoes beta
plus decay to form the daughter nucleus 57Fe
which is in an excited state having energy of
136 keV. There are two ways in which it can
make a transition to its ground state. One is
by emitting a gamma ray of energy 136 keV
and the other is by emitting a gamma ray of
energy 122 keV and going to an intermediate
state first and then emitting a photon of energy
14 keV to reach the ground state. Both these
emissions have been observed experimentally.
Which type of decay a nucleus will undergo
depends on which of the resulting daughter
nucleus is more stable. Often, the daughter
nucleus is also not stable and it undergoes
further decay. A chain of decays may take
place until the final daughter nucleus is stable.
An example of such a series decay is that of
238
U, which undergoes a series of alpha and
beta decays, a total of 14 times, to finally
reach a stable daughter nucleus of 206Pb.

Materials which undergo alpha, beta

materials. The nature of radioactivity is such
336

Activity is measured in units of becquerel (Bq)
in SI units. One becquerel is equal to one decay
per second. Another unit to measure activity is
curie (Ci). One curie is 3.7 x 1010 decays per
second. Thus, 1 Ci = 3.7 x 1010 Bq.
15.10.1. Half-life of Radioactive Material:
The time taken for the number of parent
radioactive nuclei of a particular species to
reduce to half its value is called the half-life
T1/2, of the species. This can be obtained from

even though the number goes down from N 0

to 0 in time T1/2 , after another time interval

Example 15.9: The half-life of a nuclear
species NX is 3.2 days. Calculate its
(i) decay constant, (ii) average life and

The activity is given by A = λN(t), where
N(t) is the number of nuclei in the given
sample. This is given by
N(t)= 6.02 × 1023 × 1.5 × 10-3/Y = 9.03 × 1020/Y
Here, Y is the atomic mass of nuclear
species X in g per mol.
∴ A = 9.03 × 1020 × 2.5 × 10-6/Y
= 2.257 × 1015 /Y
= 2.257 × 1015/(Y x 3.7 × 1010 ) Ci
= 6.08 × 104/Y Ci.

Example 15.11: In an alpha decay, the

and undergoes further decay. If the number
of parent and daughter nuclei at time t

i.e., to 0 . Thus, in a time interval equal to

half-life, the number of parent nuclei reduces
by a factor of ½.
15.10.2 Average Life of a Radioactive Species:
We have seen that different nuclei of a
given radioactive species decay at different
times, i.e., they have different life times. We
can calculate the average life time of a nucleus
of the material using Eq.(15.25) as described
below.
The number of nuclei decaying between

of fuel, the nuclear energy released is about a
million times that released through chemical
reactions. However, nuclear energy generation
is a very complex and expensive process and
it can also be extremely harmful. Let us learn
more about it.
We have seen in section 15.8 that the
mass of a nucleus is smaller than the sum
of masses of its constituents. The difference
in these two masses is the binding energy of
the nucleus. It would be the energy released
if the nucleus is formed by bringing together
its constituents from infinity. This energy
is large (in MeV), and this process can be a
good source of energy. In practice, we never
form nuclei starting from individual nucleons.
However, we can obtain nuclear energy by
two other processes (i) nuclear fission in which
a heavy nucleus is broken into two nuclei of
smaller masses and (ii) nuclear fusion in which
two light nuclei undergo nuclear reaction and
fuse together to form a heavier nucleus. Both
fission and fusion are nuclear reactions. Let us
understand how nuclear energy is released in
the two processes.
15.11.1. Nuclear Fission:
We have seen in Fig.15.6 that the binding
energy per nucleon (EB/A) depends on the mass
number of the nuclei. This quantity is a measure
of the stability of the nucleus. As seen from the
figure, the middle weight nuclei (mass number
ranging from 50 to 80) have highest binding
energy per nucleon and are most stable, while
nuclei with higher and lower atomic masses
have smaller values of EB/A. The value of
EB/A goes on decreasing till A~238 which is
the mass number of the heaviest naturally
occurring element which is uranium. Many of
the heavy nuclei are unstable and decay into
two smaller mass nuclei.
Let us consider a case when a heavy
nucleus, say with A ~230, breaks into two
nuclei having A between 50 and 150. The EB/A
of the product nuclei will be higher than that

constants are λp and λd respectively. What
condition needs to be satisfied in order for
Nd to remain constant?
Solution: The number of parent nuclei
decaying between time 0 and dt, for small
values of dt is given by N p λp dt . This is
the number of daughter nuclei produced
in time dt. The number of daughter nuclei
decaying in the same interval is N d λd dt .
For the number of daughter nuclei to remain
constant, these two quantities, i.e., the
number of daughter nuclei produced in time
dt and the number decaying in time dt have
to be equal. Thus, the required condition is
given by
N p p dt N d d dt ,
or, N p p N d d
15.11. Nuclear Energy:
You are familiar with the naturally
occurring, conventional sources of energy.
These include the fossil fuels, i.e., coal,
petroleum, natural gas, and fire wood. The
energy generation from these fuels is through
chemical reactions. It takes millions of years
for these fuels to form. Naturally, the supply
of these conventional sources is limited and
with indiscriminate use, they are bound to
get over in a couple of hundred years from
now. Therefore, we have to use alternative
sources of energy. The ones already in use are
hydroelectric power, solar energy, wind energy
and nuclear energy, nuclear energy being the
largest source among these.
Nuclear energy is the energy released
when nuclei undergo a nuclear reaction,
i.e., when one nucleus or a pair of nuclei,
due to their interaction, undergo a change
in their structure resulting in new nuclei and
generating energy in the process. While the
energy generated in chemical reactions is of
the order of few eV per reaction, the amount of
energy released in a nuclear reaction is of the
order of a few MeV. Thus, for the same weight

92 U

of the parent nucleus. This means that the
combined masses of the two product nuclei
will be smaller than the mass of the parent
nucleus. The difference in the mass of the
parent nucleus and that of the product nuclei
taken together will be released in the form of
energy in the process. This process in which a
heavy nucleus breaks into two lighter nuclei
with the release of energy is called nuclear
fission and is a source of nuclear energy.
One of the nuclei used in nuclear energy
generation by fusion is 236
. This has a half92 U

life of 2.3 x 10 years and an activity of 6.5 x
10-5 Ci/g. However, it being fissionable, most
of its nuclei have already decayed and it is
not found in nature. More than 99% of natural
uranium is in the form of 238
92 U and less than
235
1% is in the form of 92 U . 238

that of 236
and is therefore not very useful

can be

Some of the daughter nuclei produced are
not stable and they further decay to produce
more stable nuclei. The energy produced in the
fission is in the form of kinetic energy of the
products, i.e., in the form of heat which can
be collected and converted to other forms of
energy as needed.

device in which nuclear fission is carried out

96.91827 -2 x 1.00865] c2
= 0.19011 × 931.5 MeV
= 177.0875 MeV
Chain Reaction:
Neutrons are produced in the fission
reaction shown in Eq. (15.31). Some reactions
produce 2 neutrons while others produce 3 or
4 neutrons. The average number of neutrons
per reaction can be shown to be 2.7. These
neutrons are in turn absorbed by other 235
92 U
which
undergo
fission
nuclei to produce 236
92 U
and produce further 2.7 neutrons per fission.
This can have a cascading effect and the
number of neutrons produced and therefore the
nuclei produced can increase
number of 236
92 U
quickly. This is called a chain reaction. Such
a reaction will lead to a fast increase in the
number of fissions and thereby in a rapid
increase in the amount of energy produced.
This will lead to an explosion. In a nuclear
reactor, methods are employed to stop a chain
reaction from occurring and fission and energy
generation is allowed to occur in a controlled
fashion. The energy generated, which is in the
form of heat, is carried away and converted to
electricity by using turbines etc.
More than 15 countries have nuclear
reactors and use nuclear power. India is one of
them. There are 22 nuclear reactors in India,

Nuclear fusion is taking place all the
time in the universe. It mostly takes place at
the centres of stars where the temperatures are
high enough for nuclear reactions to take place.
There, light nuclei fuse into heavier nuclei
generating energy in the process. Nuclear
fusion is in fact the source of energy for stars.
Most of the elements heavier than boron till
iron, that we see around us today have been
produced through nuclear fusion inside stars.

the largest one being at Kudankulam, Tamil
Nadu. Maximum nuclear power is generated
by the USA.
15.11.2. Nuclear Fusion:
We have seen that light nuclei (A < 40)
have lower EB/A as compared to heavier ones.
If any two of the lighter nuclei come sufficiently
close, within about one fm of each other, then
they can undergo nuclear reaction and form a
heavier nucleus. The heavier nucleus will have
higher EB/A than the reactants. The mass of the
product nucleus will therefore be lower than the
total mass of the reactants, and energy of the
order of MeV will be released in the process.
This process wherein two nuclei fuse together
to form a heavier nucleus accompanied by a
release of nuclear energy is called nuclear
fusion.
For a nuclear reaction to take place,
it is necessary for two nuclei to come to
within about 1 fm of each other so that they
can experience the nuclear forces. It is very
difficult for two atoms to come that close to
each other due to the electrostatic repulsion
between the electrons of the two atoms. This
problem can be solved by stripping the atoms
of their electrons and producing bare nuclei.
It is possible to do so by giving the electrons
energies larger than the ionization potentials
of the atoms by heating a gas of atoms. But
even after this, the two bare nuclei find it
very difficult to go near each other due to the
repulsive force between their positive charges.
For nuclear fusion to occur, we have to heat
the gas to very high temperature thereby
providing the nuclei with very high kinetic
energies. These high energies can help them to
overcome the electrostatic repulsion and come
close to one another. As the positive charge
of a nucleus goes on increasing with increase
in its atomic number, the kinetic energies of
the nuclei, i.e., the temperature of the gas
necessary for nuclear fusion to occur goes on
increasing with increase in Z.

Do you know?
Light elements, i.e., deuterium, helium,
lithium, beryllium and boron, have not been
created inside stars, but are believed to have
been created within the first 200 second
in the life of the universe, i.e., within 200
seconds of the big bang which marked the
beginning of the universe. The temperature
at that time was very high and some
nuclear reactions could take place. After
about 200 s, the temperature decreased and
nuclear reactions were no longer possible.
The temperature at the centre of the Sun is
about 107 K. The nuclear reactions taking place
at the centre of the Sun are the fusion of four
hydrogen nuclei, i.e., protons to form a helium
nucleus. Of course, because of the electrostatic
repulsion and the values of densities at the
centre of the Sun, it is extremely unlikely
that four protons will come sufficiently close
to one another at a given time so that they
can combine to form helium. Instead, the
fusion proceeds in several steps. The effective
reaction can be written as
4 p → α + 2e+ + neutrinos + 26.7 MeV.
These reactions have been going on inside
the Sun since past 4.5 billion years and are
expected to continue for similar time period in
the future. At the centres of other stars where
temperatures are higher, nuclei heavier than
hydrogen can fuse generating energy.

tested such nuclear devices. America remains
the only country to have actually used two
atom bombs which completely destroyed the
cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in
early August 1945.

Do you know?
The fusion inside stars can only take place
between nuclei having mass number smaller
than that of iron, i.e., 56. The reason for
this is that iron has the highest EB/A value
among all elements as seen from Fig.15.6.
If an iron nucleus fuses into another
nucleus, the atomic number of the resulting
nucleus will be higher than that of iron and
hence it will have smaller EB/A. The mass
of the resultant nucleus will hence be larger
than the sum of masses of the reactants
and energy will have to be supplied to the
reactants for the reaction to take place.
The elements heavier than iron which are
present in the universe are produced via
other type of nuclear reaction which take
place during stellar explosions.

Do you know?
We have seen that the activity of radioactive
material decreases exponentially with time.
Other examples of exponential decay are
• Amplitude of a simple pendulom decays
exponentially as A =A0 e-bt, where b is
damping factor.
• Cooling of an object in an open
surrounding is exponential. Temperature
θ = θ 0e-kt where k depends upon the
object and the surrounding.
• Discharging of a capacitor through a
pure resistor is exponential. Charge Q
on the capacitor at a given instant is
Q = Q0 e-[t/RC] where RC is called time
constant.
• Charging of a capacitor is also
exponential but, it is called exponential
growth.

The discussion on nuclear energy will not
be complete without mentioning its harmful
effects. If an uncontrolled chain reaction sets
up in a nuclear fuel, an extremely large amount
of energy can be generated in a very short
time. This fact has been used to produce what
are called atom bombs or nuclear devices.
Either fission alone or both fission and fusion
are used in these bombs. The first such devices
were made towards the end of the second world
war by America. By now, several countries
including India have successfully made and

16. Semiconductor Devices
Can you recall?
1. What is a p-n junction diode?
2. What is breakdown voltage and knee
voltage?
3. What is a forward and reverse biased
diode?
16.1 Introduction
In XI th Std. we have studied a p-n junction
diode. When the diode is forward biased,
it behaves as a closed switch and current
flows in the diode circuit. When the diode is
reverse biased, it behaves as an open switch
and no current flows in the diode circuit. This
switching action of a diode allows it to be used
as a rectifier.
Generation of AC at a power station is
more cost effective than producing DC power.
The transmission of AC power is also more
economic than transmitting DC power. This
AC voltage varies sinusoidally. In India, it is
230 V and has a frequency of 50 Hz. There
are many electronic gadgets such as a TV, or
a mobile charger which require a DC supply.
Therefore, it is necessary to convert AC voltage
into a DC voltage. The AC mains voltage is
rectified by using junction diodes to obtain a
DC voltage. In this chapter, we will study the
use of diode as a rectifier and also different
types of rectifiers. We will also study filters
which remove the AC component from the
rectified voltage and voltage regulators which
provide the required DC voltage.

Working of a simple rectifier circuit is
shown in Fig. 16.1. The AC mains supply is
connected to the primary of a transformer
and its secondary is connected to a rectifier
circuit. The AC voltage shown as a sinusoidal
wave from the secondary of the transformer
is converted into a DC voltage by a diode
rectifier. This is shown next as a pulsating
wave (b). The output of the rectifier contains
some AC component. This AC component in
the DC output of a rectifier is called ripple
and is shown at the output of the rectifier. It
is removed by using a filter circuit. The output
of the filter circuit is almost a pure DC. (It
can still contain some ripple). The voltage
regulator circuit shown after the filter restricts
the output voltage to the desired value. The
output voltage at this stage is a across pure
DC (d).
16.2 p-n Junction Diode as a Rectifier
An AC voltage varies sinusoidally, i.e. its
value and direction changes in one cycle. A
rectifier converts this bidirectional voltage or
current into a unidirectional voltage or current.
The conversion of AC voltage into a DC voltage
is called rectification. An electronic circuit
which rectifies AC voltage is called rectifier.
There are two types of rectifier circuits, 1) half
wave rectifier and 2) full wave rectifier.
16.2.1 Half Wave Rectifier
A simple half wave rectifier circuit using
only one diode is shown in Fig. 16.2.

AC

344

Hence a DC output voltage obtained
across RL is in the form of alternate pulses.
16.2.2 Full Wave Rectifier:
As discussed in the previous section, the
output of a half wave rectifier is available
only in alternate positive half cycles of the AC
input. All negative half cycles are lost and the
efficiency of a half wave rectifier is very poor.
Therefore, a rectifier circuit using two diodes
is more useful.
In a full wave rectifier, current flows
through the load in the same direction during
both the half cycles of input AC voltage.
This is because, the full wave rectifier circuit
consists of two diodes conducting alternately.
Figure 16.4 shows typical circuit of a full wave
rectifier. The circuit consists of a centre tapped
transformer and diodes D1 and D2.

Fig. 16.2: Circuit diagram of a half wave
rectifier.

The secondary coil AB of a transformer
is connected in series with a diode D and the
load resistance RL. The use of transformer has
two advantages. First, it allows us to step up
or step down the AC input voltage as per the
requirement of the circuit, and second it isolates
the rectifier circuit from the mains supply
to reduce the risk of electric shock. The AC
voltage across the secondary coil AB changes
its polarities after every half cycle. When the
positive half cycle begins, the voltage at the
point A is at higher potential with respect to
that at the point B, therefore, the diode (D) is
forward biased. It conducts (works as a closed
switch) and current flows through the circuit.
When the negative half cycle begins, the
potential at the point A is lower with respect
to that at the point B and the diode is reverse
biased, therefore, it does not conduct (works as
an open switch). No current passes through the
circuit. Hence, the diode conducts only in the
positive half cycles of the AC input. It blocks
the current during the negative half cycles. The
waveform for input and output voltages are
shown in Fig. 16.3. In this way, current always
flows through the load RL in the same direction
for alternate positive half cycles. 		

Fig. 16.4: Circuit diagram for full wave rectifier.

The diodes D1 and D2 are connected such
that D1 conducts in the positive half cycle
and D2 conducts in the negative half cycle
of the input voltage. During the positive half
cycle of the input voltage, the point A is at a
higher potential than that of the point B and
the diode D1 conducts. The current through the
load resistance RL follows the path APQRC
as shown in Fig. 16.4. During the negative
half cycle of the input voltage, point B is at
higher potential than point A and the diode
D2 conducts. The current through the load
resistance RL follows the path BPQRC. Thus,
the current flowing through the load resistance
is in the same direction during both the cycles.
The input and output waveforms of a full
wave rectifier are shown in Fig. 16.5. First
waveform is input AC. The second wave form
shows the output when the diode D1 conducts
and the third waveform shows the output
when diode D2 conducts. The fourth waveform

for half wave rectifier.

wave rectifier.

16.2.3 Ripple Factor:
The output of a rectifier consists of a
small fraction of an A C component along with
DC called the ripple. This ripple is undesirable
and is responsible for the fluctuations in the
rectifier output. Figure 16.6 (a) shows the
ripple in the output of a rectifier.
The effectiveness of a rectifier depends
upon the magnitude of the ripple component
in its output. A smaller ripple means that the
rectifier is more effective.

signals for a full wave rectifier.

Remember this
A full wave rectifier utilises both half
cycles of AC input voltage to produce the
DC output

time

The ratio of root mean square (rms) value
of the AC component to the value of the DC
component in the rectifier output is known as
the ripple factor, i.e.,
r .m. s.value of AC component
Ripple factor = 
value of DC component
16.2.4 Filter circuits:
The output of a rectifier is in the form
of pulses as shown in the fourth waveform
in Fig 16.5.The output is unidirectional but
the output does not have a steady value. It
keeps fluctuating due to the ripple component
present in it. A filter circuit is used to remove
the ripple from the output of a rectifier.
A filter circuit is a circuit which removes
the AC component or the ripple from a rectifier
output and allows only the DC component.

Do you know?
The maximum efficiency of a full wave
rectifier is 81.2% and the maximum
efficiency of a half wave rectifier is 40.6%.
It is observed that the maximum efficiency
of a full wave rectifier is twice that of half
wave rectifier.
Advantages of a full wave rectifier
1) Rectification takes place in both the
cycles of the AC input.
2) Efficiency of a full wave rectifier is
higher than that of a half wave rectifier.
3) The ripple in a full wave rectifier is less
than that in a half wave rectifier.
Example 16.1 : If the frequency of the input
voltage50 Hz is applied to a (a) half wave
rectifier and (b) full wave rectifier, what is
the output frequency in both cases?
Solution:
(a) The output frequency is 50 Hz because
for one AC input pulsating we get one
cycle of DC.
(b) The output frequency is 100Hz because
for one input ac cycle we get two cycles
of pulsating DC.

Fig. 16.6 (b): Filter circuit with capacitor.

346

Fig. 16.6 (c): Output wave form ofter filtration.

A capacitor filter:
As shown in Fig. 16.6 (b), the pulsating
DC voltage of a rectifier output is applied
across the capacitor. As the voltage across the
capacitor rises, capacitor gets charged to point
A and supplies current to the load resistance.
At the end of quarter cycle, the capacitor gets
charged to the peak voltage shown as Vp in
Fig. 16.7 (c) of the rectified output voltage.
Now, the rectifier voltage begins to decrease,
so that the capacitor starts discharging
through the load resistance and the voltage
across it begins to drop. Voltage across the
load decreases only slightly, up to the point
B, because the next voltage peak recharges
the capacitor immediately. This process is
repeated again and again and the output
voltage waveform takes the form shown in Fig
16.6 (c). This output is unregulated DC wave
form. Voltage, regulator circuits are used to
obtain regulated DC supply The capacitor
filter circuit is widely used because of its low
cost, small size and light weight. This type of
filter is preferred for small load currents. It is
commonly used in battery eliminators.
When a power supply is connected to a
load, it is noticed that there is a drop in the
output voltage. A power supply whose output
changes when a load is connected across it is
called unregulated power supply. When the
output of a power supply remains steady even
after connecting a load across it, it is called a
regulated power supply. There are many ways
in which a power supply can be regulated. A
commonly used voltage regulator circuit uses
a Zener diode. We will now discuss a Zener
347

diode first and then try to understand how it
can be used as a voltage regulator.
16.3 Special Purpose Junction Diodes:
In this section we will study some of the
common special purpose junction diodes such
as,
1) Zener diode, 2) Photo diode, 3) Solar cell, 4)
Light Emitting Diode (LED).
16.3.1 Zener Diode:
A Zener diode works on the principle
of junction breakdown. The other diodes
mentioned above make use of photosensitivity,
a very important and useful property of
semiconductors.
16.3 : Junction Break Down:
In XIth Std. we have studied that when
reverse bias voltage of an ordinary junction
diode is increased beyond a critical voltage,
the reverse current increases sharply to a high
value. This critical voltage is called reverse
breakdown voltage. The diode is damaged at
this stage. We will now discuss what happens
when there is a junction breakdown.
Electrical break down of any material
(metal, semiconductor or even insulator) can
be due to 1) Avalanche breakdown or 2)
Zener breakdown. We will discuss only the
Zener breakdown in some details.
Zener Breakdown :
When the reverse voltage across a p-n
junction diode is increased, the electric field
across the junction increases. This results in a
force of attraction on the negatively charged
electrons at the junction. Covalent bonds which
hold the semiconductor together are broken
due to this force and electrons are removed
from the bonds. These free electrons are then
available for electrical conduction and result
in a large current. When the applied voltage is
increased, the electric field across the junction
also increases and more and more electrons
are removed from their covalent bonds. Thus,
a net current is developed which increases
rapidly with increase in the applied voltage.

This property of the Zener diode is used in
a voltage regulator. The Zener voltage VZ
depends upon the amount of doping. For a
heavily doped diode, the depletion layer is thin
and the breakdown occurs at a lower reverse
voltage. A lightly doped diode has higher
breakdown voltage. The Zener diodes with
breakdown voltage of less than 6 V, operate
mainly at Zener breakdown region. Those
with voltage greater the 6 V operate mainly
in avalanche breakdown region (not discussed
here) but both are called Zener diode.
Zener diode as a voltage regulator:
When a Zener diode is operated in the
breakdown region, voltage across it remains
almost constant even if the current through it
changes by a large amount. A voltage regulator
maintains a constant voltage across a load
regardless of variations in the applied input
voltage and variations in the load current.
Figure 16.8 shows a typical circuit diagram of
a voltage regulator using a Zener diode.

Zener breakdown occurs in diodes which
are heavily doped. The depletion layer is
narrow in such diodes. Zener breakdown does
not result in damage of a diode.
Zener Diode Characteristic:
A Zener diode is a p-n junction diode
designed to work in the breakdown region.
It is used as a voltage regulator or a voltage
stabiliser. Figure 16.7 (a) shows the circuit
symbol of a Zener diode. Its I-V characteristic
is shown in Fig. 16.7 (b).
Fig 16.7 (a): circuit
symbol of a Zener diode.

Fig. 16.8: Voltage regulator using a Zener diode.

A Zener diode of break down voltage VZ
is connected in reverse bias to an input voltage
source Vi. The resistor, RS connected in series
with the Zener diode limits the current flow
through the diode. The load resistance RL is
connected in parallel with the Zener diode, so
that the voltage across RL is always the same
as the Zener voltage, ( VR = VZ ). We will try
to understand how voltage is regulated using
such circuit.
(a) If the input voltage increases, the
current through Rs and the Zener diode also
increases. This results in an increase in the

Fig 16.7: (b) I-V Characteristic curve for
Zener Diode.

As can be seen from the characteristic, a
Zener diode behaves like a normal diode when
forward biased. When reverse biased, it shows
a breakdown. This breakdown discussed
previously occurs at a voltage called the Zener
voltage Vz. The current suddenly increases if
the applied voltage is increased beyond the
Zener voltage. It is interesting to note that the
voltage remains constant at VZ, for increasing
current, once the Zener breakdown occurs.

voltage across the resistance Rs, but the voltage
across the Zener diode does not change. The
series resistance Rs absorbs the output voltage
fluctuations and maintains a constant voltage
across the load resistance. This is because the
Zener voltage remains constant even through
the current through the Zener diode changes
when it is in the breakdown region.

Do you know?
The voltage stabilization is effective
when there is a minimum Zener current.
The Zener diode must be always operated
within its breakdown region when there is a
load connected in the circuit. Similarly, the
supply voltage VS must be greater than VZ.

When the input voltage increases, the
voltage across the series resistance Rs also
increases. This causes an increase in the
current through the Zener diode and the current
through the load resistance remains constant.
Hence the output voltage remains constant
irrespective of the change in the input voltage.

Working of a Zener Regulator:
Let IZ(min), IZ(max) be the minimum and
maximum Zener currents respectively and VZ
be the Zener voltage.
Let VS, be the voltage across RSwhen the
current is minimum, therefore, VS = (IZ(min) RS).
Eq. (16.1).
From the Fig. 16.8, we have,
Vin= (VS+VZ). Thus, the lower value of the
input voltage is,
Vin(low)= (VS + VZ).

(b) When the input voltage is constant
but the load resistance RL decreases, the load
current increases. This extra current cannot
come from the source because the drop across
Rs will not change as the Zener is within its
regulating range. The additional load current
is due to a decrease in the Zener current IZ.

∴ Vin(low) = IZ(min)RS + VZ

--- (16.2)

Similarly, the voltage across RS when the
current is maximum will be, VS = (IZ(max)RS)
and
Vin(high)= (VS + VZ) = (IZ(max)R) + VZ

(c) When there is no load in the circuit, the
load current will be zero, ( IL = 0 ) and all the
circuit current passes through the Zener diode.
This results in maximum dissipation of power
across the Zener diode. Similarly, a small
value of the series resistor RS results in a larger
diode current when the load resistance RL of
a large value is connected across it. This will
increases the power dissipation requirement of
the diode. The value of the series resistance RS
is so selected that the maximum power rating
of the Zener diode is not exceeded when there
is no load or when the load is very high.

The maximum power rating (PZ) of a
Zener diode is given by, PZ = (IZ(max)VZ).
While designing a Zener regulator, the
value of series resistance is determined by
considering the specification of the Zener
diode.
Similarly, if the input voltage (Vi)
decreases, the current through Rs and the
Zener diode also decreases. Therefore, VS, the
voltage drop across RS also decreases without
any change in the voltage VZ, across the Zener
diode. Hence, any change in the input voltage
does not change the voltage across the Zener
diode. Thus, a Zener diode gives constant
output voltage (VO) across RL. The limitation
of this regulator is that the current through
a Zener diode should never exceed the IZ(max)
value. If the current exceeds this value, the

The voltage across the Zener diode
remains constant at its break down voltage

long as the current persists in the break down

Zener diode gets damaged due to heating. The
IZ(max) value is provided by manufacturer.

Can you tell?
1. How does a cell phone charger produce
a voltage of 5.0 V form the line voltage
of 230V?
2. Why is a resistance connected in series
with a Zener diode when used in a
circuit?

Remember this
Zener effect occurs only if the diode is
heavily doped, because when the depletion
layer is thin, breakdown occurs at low
reverse voltage and the field strength will
be approximately 3x107 V/m. It causes an
increase in the flow of free carriers and
increase in the reverse current.

Do you know?
The voltage across a Zener diode does not
remain strictly constant with the changes
in the Zener current. This is due to RZ, the
Zener impedance, or the internal resistance
of the Zener diode. RZ acts like a small
resistance in series with the Zener. Changes
in IZ cause small changes in VZ .

Applications of Zener Diode: The Zener
diode is used when a constant voltage is
required. It has a number of applications
such as: Voltage regulator, Fixed reference
voltage provider in transistor biasing circuits,
Peak clipper or limiter in a wave shaping
circuit, Protector against meter damage from
accidental fluctuations, etc.

16.3.2 Photo Diode :
A photodiode is a special type of a p-n
junction diode which converts light energy
into electrical energy. It generates current
when exposed to light. It is also called as
photodetector or a photosensor. It operates in
reverse biased mode. Figure 16.9 (a) shows the

field present in the depletion region. The
electrons are attracted towards the anode and
the holes are attracted towards the cathode.
More carriers are available for conduction
and the reverse current is increased. The
reverse current of a photodiode depends on the
intensity of the incident light. Thus, the reverse
current can be controlled by controlling
the concentration of the minority carriers
in the junction. Figure 16.11 shows the I-V
characteristic of a photodiode. It clearly shows
the relation between intensity of illumination
and the reverse current of a photodiode.

The p-n junction of a photodiode is
placed inside a glass material so that only
the junction of a photodiode is exposed to
light. Other part of the diode is generally
painted with an opaque colour or covered.
Figure 16.9 (c) shows a typical photodiode.

Fig. 16.9 (c) : A typical photodiode.

Working Principle of Photodiode:
When a p-n junction diode is reverse
biased, a reverse saturation current flows
through the junction. The magnitude of this
current is constant for a certain range of
reverse bias voltages. This current is due to the
minority carriers on its either side.(Electrons
are minority carriers in the p-region and the
holes are minority carriers in the p-region of
a diode). The reverse current depends only
on the concentration of the minority carriers
and not on the applied voltage. This current
is called the dark currant in a photodiode
because it flows even when the photodiode is
not illuminated. Figure 16.10 schematically
shows working of a photodiode.

Fig. 16.11: The I-V characteristic of a
photodiode.

The total current passing through a
photodiode is the sum of the photocurrent
and the dark current. Figure 16.12 shows
the graphical relation between the reverse
current of a photodiode and the intensity of
illumination incident on the photodiode. The
sensitivity of the device can be increased by
minimizing the dark current.

Figure 16.10: schematically shows working of a
photodiode.

When a p-n junction is illuminated,
electron-hole pairs are generated in the
depletion region. The energy of the incident
photons should be larger than the band gap of
the semiconductor material used to fabricate
the photodiode. The electrons and the holes
are separated due to the intrinsic electric

of a photodiode and the intensity of illumination

351

As you can see from the curve, reverse
current increases initially with increase in the
intensity of illumination. It reaches a constant
value after certain voltage is reached. This
constant value is called the saturation current
of the photodiode. One more term associated
with a photodiode is its dark resistance Rd. It
is the resistance of a photodiode when it is not
illuminated. Dark resistance of a photodiode
(Rd) is defined as the ratio of the maximum
reverse voltage and its dark current.
Maximum reverse voltage
Rd =
Dark current
Advantages of photodiode
1) Quick response when exposed to light.
2) Linear response. The reverse current
is linearly proportional to intensity of
incident light.
3) High speed of operations.
4) Light weight and compact size.
5) Wide spectral response. For example,
photodiodes made from Si respond to
radiation of wavelengths from 190 nm
(UV) to 1100 nm (IR).
6) Relatively low cost.
Disadvantages of photodiode
1) Its properties are temperature dependent,
similar to many other semiconductor
devices.
2) Low reverse current for low illumination
levels.
Applications of photodiode
A photodiode has many applications in a
number of fields ranging from domestic
applications to industrial applications due to
its linear response. The basic concept used in
almost all these devices/applications is that a
photodiode conducts whenever light strikes it
and it stops conducting the moment light stops.
Some applications of a photodiode are:
1) Counters and switches.
2) Burglar alarm systems.
3) Detection of visible and invisible
radiations.
4) Circuits in which fast switching and highspeed operations are required.
5) Fiber optic communication systems.
6) Optocouplers, used to provide an electric
isolation between two electronic circuits.
352

7) Photo sensors/detectors, for accurate
measurement of light intensity.
8) Safety electronics like fire and smoke
detectors

16.3.3 Solar Cell or Photovoltaic Cell:
Solar energy can be used in many ways. It
pollution freez and available free of cost. Two
major types of devices converting solar energy
in usable form are, a) Photo thermal devices
which convert the solar energy into heat energy.
These are mostly used for providing hot water.
and b) Photo voltaic devices which convert
solar energy into electrical energy using solar
cells. We will discuss the solar cells in some
details. It is also known as photovoltaic cell.
Light incident on a solar cell produces both
a current and a voltage to generate electric
power. A solar cell thus works as a source of
DC power. Solar cells can supply power for
electric equipment at remote place on earth or
aboard a satellite or a space station.
Structure of a Solar Cell:

Fig.16.13: (a) Schematic structure of a solar cell.

Figure 16.13 (a) shows the schematic
structure of a solar cell. It consists of a p-n
junction. The n-side of the junction faces
the solar radiation. The p-side is relatively
thick and is at the back of the solar cell. Both
the p-side and the n-side are coated with a
conducting material. The n-side is coated with
antireflection coating which allows visible

light to pass through it. The main function of
this coating is to reflect the IR (heat) radiations
and protect the solar cell from heat. This is
necessary, because the electronic properties
of semiconductors are sensitive to fluctuations
in temperature. This coating works as the
electrical contact of the solar cell. The contact
on the n-side is called the front contact and
that at the p-side is called the back contact or
the rear contact. The n-side of a solar cell is
thin so that the light incident on it reaches the
depletion region where the electron-hole pairs
are generated.
Material used for fabricating a solar
cell should fulfil two important requirements.
Firstly, it must be photosensitive material
which absorbs light and raises electrons to
a higher energy state. Secondly, the higher
energy electrons thus generated should be
taken from the solar cell into an external
circuit. The electrons then dissipate their
energy while passing through the external
circuit and return to the solar cell. Almost
all photovoltaic devices use semiconductor
materials in the form of a p-n junction.
Working of a solar cell:
When light is incident on a solar cell, the
following sequence of events takes place.
1) Electron-hole pairs are generated in the
depletion region of the p-n junction.
These are photo-generated carriers.
2) The electrons and holes are separated
and collected at the cathode and the
anode respectively.
3) The carriers are accumulated and
generate a voltage across the solar cell.
4) Power thus produced is dissipated
(utilised) in the load resistance or in the
circuit connected across the solar cell.
Current produced in a in a solar cell is
called the ‘light-generated current’, or ‘photogenerated current’. This is a two-step process.
The first step is the absorption of incident
photons to generate electron-hole pairs.
Electron-hole pairs will be generated in the
solar cell provided that the incident photon
has energy greater than that of the band
gap. Normally, the electrons and holes thus

produced recombine and will be lost. There
will be no generation of current or power.
However, the photo-generated electrons (in
the p-type material), and the photo-generated
holes (in the n-type material) are spatially
separated and prevented from recombination
in a solar cell.

Fig. 16.13: (b) Separation of carriers in a solar cell.

This separation of carriers is possible
due to the intrinsic electric field of the
depletion region. Figure 16. 13 (b) shows
this schematically. When the light-generated
electron in the in the p-type region reaches the
p-n junction, it is swept across the junction by
the electric field at the junction. It reaches the
n-type region where it is now a majority carrier.
Similarly, the light generated hole reaches the
p-type region and becomes a majority carrier
in it. The positive and negative charges are thus
accumulated on the p-region and the n-region
of the solar cell which can be used as a voltage
source. When the solar cell is connected to an
external circuit, the light-generated carriers
flow through the external circuit.
V-I Characteristic of solar Cell or
Photovoltaic cell:

Fig. 16.14 :V-I Characteristic of solar Cell or
Photovoltaic cell

353

Figure 16.14 shows the I-V characteristic
of solar cell when illuminated. This is drawn in
the fourth quadrant because a solar cell supplies
current to the load. The power delivered to the
load is zero when the load is short-circuited.
The intersection of the curve with the I-axis
is the short-circuit current, Isc, corresponding
to a given light intensity. The intersection of
the curve with the V- axis is the open circuit
voltage, Voc, corresponding to given light
intensity. Again, power delivered to the load
is zero when the load is open. However, there
is a point on the curve where power delivered
PL = (VoL. Isc) is maximum.
Criteria for selection of material for solar
cell:
1) Its band gap should be between 1.0 eV to
1.8 eV.
2) It should have high optical absorption
(conversion of light into electrical
energy).
3) It should have good electrical
conductivity.
4) Material should be easily available.
Most materials used for fabrication of solar
cells are have a band gap of about 1.5 eV.
These include: Si (Eg = 1.1 eV), GaAs
(Eg =1.43 eV), CdTe(Eg = 1.45 eV), CuInSe
(Eg =1.04 eV). Solar cells used in domestic
and space applications are mostly Si based
solar cells. Solar cells are non-polluting, they
require less maintenance and last longer. They
have a higher cost of installation, are low in
efficiency.
Use of Solar cell:
Solar cells are used for charging batteries
during day time so that batteries can supply
power during night. They are useful at remote
places, for supplying power to various
electronic equipment from calculators to
satellites and space stations, to supply power
to traffic signals, in communication stations,
and in Lux meter to measure intensity of light.

What is the difference between a photo
diode and a solar cell?
When the intensity of light incident on a
photo diode increases, how is the reverse
current affected?
16.3.4 Light Emitting Diode / LED:
The Light Emitting Diode or LED as it
is more commonly called is a diode which
emits light when large forward current passes
through it.

Figure 16.15 (a) shows the circuit
symbol of LED and the Fig. 16.15 (b) shows
a schematic construction of a typical LED.
The construction of a LED is different from
that of a normal diode. The n-region is
heavily doped than the p-region of the p-n
junction. The LED p-n junction is encased in
a dome-shaped transparent case so that light is
emitted uniformly in all directions and internal
reflections are minimized. Metal electrodes
attached on either side of the p-n junction serve
as contacts for external electrical connection.
The larger leg of a LED is the positive electrode
or anode. LEDs with more than 2 pins are also
available such as 3, 4 and 6 pin configurations
to obtain multi-colours in the same LED
package. Surface mounted LED displays are
available that can be mounted on PCBs.

produce light of different wavelengths. For
example, when LED is manufactured using
aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs), it emits
infrared radiations. LED made using gallium
arsenic phosphide (GaAsP) produces either
red or yellow light, whereas LED made by
using aluminium gallium phosphide (AlGaP)
emits red or green light and zinc selenide
(ZnSe) produce blue light.

Do you know?
LED junction does not actually emit that
much light so the epoxy resin body is
constructed in such a way that the photons
emitted by the junction are reflected away
from the surrounding substrate base to
which the diode is attached and are focused
upwards through the domed top of the LED,
which itself acts like a lens concentrating
the light. This is why the emitted light
appears to be brightest at the top of the LED.
Working of a LED:
Figure 16.16 schematically shows the
emission of light when electron-hole pair
combines. When the diode is forward biased,
electrons from the semiconductor's conduction
band recombine with holes from the valence
band releasing sufficient energy to produce
photons which emit a monochromatic (single
colour) light. Because of the thin layer, a
reasonable number of these photons can leave
the junction and emit coloured light. The
amount of light output is directly proportional
to the forward current. Thus, higher the forward
current, higher is the light output.

Characteristic Curves showing different
colours available.

I-V Characteristics Light Emitting Diodes:
Figure 16.17 shows the I-V characteristic
of
LED. It is similar to the forward
characteristic of an ordinary diode.
Remember this
The current rating of LED is of a few tens
of milli-amps. Hence it is necessary to
connect a high resistance in series with it.
The forward voltage drop of an LED is
much larger than an ordinary diode and is
around 1.5 to 3.5 volts.
Advantages of LED:
LED is a solid state light source.
1. Energy efficient: More light output for
lesser electrical power. LEDs are now
capable of producing 135 lumens/watt
2. Long Lifetime: 50,000 hours or more if
properly manufactured.
3. Rugged: LEDs are also called Solid State
Lights (SSL) as they are made of solid
material with no filament or tube or bulb
to break.

semiconductors made with elements such as
gallium, phosphorus and arsenic. By varying

White Light LEDs or White LED Lamps:
Shuji Nakamura, a Japanese - born
American electronic engineer invented the
blue LED. He was awarded the Nobel prize
for physics for 2014. He was also awarded
the global energy prize in the year 2015. His
invention of blue LED made the fabrication
of white LED possible.
LED lamps, bulbs, street lighting are
becoming very popular these days because
of the very high efficiency of LEDs in terms
of light output per unit input power(in milli
Watts), as compared to the incandescent
bulbs. So for general purpose lightings,
white light is preferred.
Commercially available white LEDs
are normally manufactured by using the
technique of wavelength conversion. It
is a process which partly or completely
converts the radiation of a LED into white
light. There are many ways of wavelength
conversion. One of these methods uses blue
LED and yellow phosphor. In this method
of wavelength conversion, a LED which
emits blue colour is used to excite a yellow
colour phosphor. This results in the emission
of yellow and blue light and this mixture of
blue and yellow light gives the appearance
of white light. This method is the least
expensive method for producing white light.

16.4 Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT):
A junction transistor is a semiconductor
device having two junctions and three
terminals. The current in a transistor is carried
by both the electrons and the holes. Hence,
it is called a bipolar junction transistor. A
transistor has three doped regions which form
a structure with two back to back p-n junctions.
There are two types of transistors, namely,
(a) n-p-n transistor (b) p-n-p transistor. The
circuit symbols and schematic representation
of the two types of transistors are shown in
Fig. 16.18 (a).

shown in the Fig. 16.18 (b).
In an n-p-n transistor, a p-type
semiconductor (base) layer separates two
layers of the n-type semiconductor (emitter
and collector). It is obtained by growing a thin
layer of p-type semiconductor in between two

Depletion region: The depletion regions are
formed at the emitter-base junction and the
base-collector junction.
Current: The emitter current IE, the base
current IB and the collector current IC is as
indicated in the Fig. 16.19 (d).
Resistance: The emitter-base junction has low
resistance while the base-collector junction
has a high resistance.
There are two p-n junctions in a transistor,
the emitter-base (E-B) junction and the
collector-base (E-B) junction, and they can be
biased in different ways. In the most common
method of biasing a transistor, the emitter base
junction is forward biased and the collector
base junction is reverse biased. This helps an
easy flow of the majority carriers supplied by
the emitter through the transistor.

Similarly, for a p-n-p transistor, a n-type
semiconductor (base) layer separates two
layers of p-type semiconductor (emitter and
collector). It is obtained by growing a thin
layer of n-type semiconductor in between two
relatively thick layers of p type semiconductor.
The three layers of a transistor are the Emitter
(E), the Base (b) and the Collector (C)
(Fig.16.18 (b)).
A transistor can be thought to be two
junction diodes connected back to back. This
two-diode analogy is shown in Fig.16.19 (c).

What would happen if both junctions of a
BJT are forward biased or reverse biased?
Working of a p-n-p transistor:
Electrons are the majority carriers in the
emitter of a n-p-n transistor. The emitter current
IE is due to electrons. The current flowing
through the E-B junction is large because it
is forward biased. The B-C junction is also
large though the junction is reverse biased. It
is interesting to know how this is possible.

Figure 16.19 (a) shows typical biasing
circuit of a n-p-n transistor. At the instant the
forward bias is applied to the E-B junction,
electrons in the emitter region (n-type) have
not entered the base region (p-type) as shown
in Fig. 16.19 (b).

Emitter: It is a thick heavily doped layer. This
supplies a large number of majority carriers
for the current flow through the transistor
Base: It is the thin, lightly doped central layer.
Collector: It is on the other side of the base. It
is also thick and moderately doped layer. Its
area is larger than that of the emitter and the
base. This layer collects a major portion of the
majority carriers supplied by the emitter. The
collector also helps dissipation of any small
amount of heat generated.

Remember this
The lightly doped, thin base region
sandwiched between the heavily doped
emitter region and the intermediate doped
collector region plays a crucial role in the
transistor action.
Transistor configuration:
The possible configurations of transistor
in a circuit are, (a) Common Emitter, CE
(b) Common Base, CB and (c) Common
Collector, CC.
Common Emitter configuration
The emitter of the transistor is common to
both the input and the output, Fig. 16.20 (a).

Fig. 16.19 (c): Injection of majority carriers
into base.

These electrons can now flow in two
directions. They can either flow through the
base circuit and constitute the base current
(IB), or they can also flow through the collector
circuit and contribute towards the collector
current (IC). The base current is small (about
5% of IE) because the base is thin and also, it
is lightly doped.
The base of a transistor plays a crucial
role in its action. Electrons injected from the
emitter into the base diffuse into the collectorbase depletion region due to the thin base
region. When the electrons enter the collectorbase depletion region, they are pushed into
the collector region by the electric field at the
collector-base depletion region. The collector
current (IC) flow through the external circuit as
shown in Fig. 19.16 (d). The collector current
IC is about 95% of IE.
Majority of the electrons injected by the

emitter into the base are thus collected by the
collector and flow through the collector circuit.
A p-n-p transistor works exactly the same
way except that the majority carriers are now
holes.
From the schematic working shown in Fig.
16.19, we can write IE = IB + IC. Since the base
current IB is very small we can write IC ≈ IE.

Fig. 16.20 (c): Common collector configuration.

16.4.1 The Common Emitter (CE)
Configuration
We will discuss the common emitter
configuration in some details because it is the
most commonly used configuration.
358

In the Common Emitter or grounded
emitter configuration, the input signal is
applied between the base and the emitter, while
the output is obtained between the collector
and the emitter as shown in the Fig. 16.21.

Since the electrical relationship between
these three currents IB, IC and IE is determined
by the physical construction of the transistor
itself, any small change in the base current
(IB), will result in a much larger change in the
collector current (IC). Thus, a small change
in current flowing in the base will control the
current in the emitter-collector circuit. Typical
value of bDC is between 20 and 200 for most
general purpose transistors. So if a transistor
has a bDC = 100, then one electron will flow
from the base terminal for every 100 electrons
flowing between the emitter-collector terminal.

Fig.16.21: The Common Emitter configuration.

The
common
emitter
amplifier
configuration, to be discussed in section
16.4.3, produces the highest current and
power gain of all the three bipolar transistor
configurations. This is mainly because the
input impedance is low as it is connected to a
forward biased p-n junction, while the output
impedance is high as it is taken from a reverse
biased p-n junction.
In this type of configuration, the current
flowing out of the transistor must be equal to
the currents flowing into the transistor as the
emitter current is given by,
		 IE = IC + IB			--- (16.1)
As the load resistance ( RL ) is connected
in series with the collector, the current gain of
the common emitter transistor configuration
is quite large. The current gain is called the
current amplification factor and is defined as
the ratio
bDC = IC/IB 			--- (16.2)
Similarly, the ratio of the collector current
and the emitter current is defined as
aDC = IC/IE 			--- (16.3)

16.4.2 The Common Emitter (CE)
characteristic:
A typical circuit used to study the common
emitter (CE) characteristic is shown in the
Fig. 16.22.

Fig. 16.22: Circuit to study Common Emitter
(CE) characteristic.

The Input characteristics:
The variation of base current IB with
base-emitter voltage, VBE , is called input
characteristic. While studying the dependence
of IB on VBE , the collector-emitter voltage VCE
is kept fixed. The characteristic is shown in the
Fig. 16.23.
As we can see from the figure, initially,
the current is very small till the barrier potential
is overcome. When the voltage VBE is more
than the barrier potential, the characteristic is
similar to that of a forward biased diode.
The input dynamic resistance ri of a
transistor is defined as the ratio of the change
in the base-emitter voltage and the resulting
change in the base current at a constant
collector-base voltage.

The ratios aDC and bDC are related.

shows a typical circuit used for transistor
amplifier.
A small sinusoidal input signal is
superimposed on the DC bias as shown in the
Fig. 16.25. The base current IB and the collector
current IC will have these sinusoidal variations
superimposed on them. This causes the output
voltage VO also to change sinusoidally. A
capacitor is connected in the output circuit to
block the DC component. A load resistance RL
is connected in the collector circuit. Output is
obtained across this resistance.

The variation of the collector current
IC with variation in the collector-emitter
voltage is called the output characteristic of
a transistor. The base current IB is constant at
this time. From the curve we can see that the,
collector current IC is independent of VCE as
long as the collector-emitter junction is reverse
biased. Also, the collector current IC is large
for large values of the base current IB when VCE
is constant.
The output dynamic resistance ro of a
transistor is defined as the ratio of the change
in the collector-emitter voltage VCE and the
change in the collector current IC for constant
base current IB.

Working of the amplifier:
Let us discuss the working of the amplifier
when the input signal vi is not applied.
Consider the output loop. We have, from the
Kirchhoff’s law,
VCC = VCE + ICRL

Similarly, for the input loop we have,

(+5 V) value. An electronic circuit that handles
only a digital signal is called a digital circuit,
and the branch of electronics which deals with
digital circuits is called digital electronics.
Logic gate:
A digital circuit with one or more input
signals but only one output signal is called a
logic gate. It is a switching circuit that follows
curtain logical relationship between the input
and output voltages. Therefore, they are
generally known as logic gates; gates because
they control the flow of signal or information .
The output of a logic gate can have only one
of the two possible states, i.e., either a high
voltage or low voltage.

Whether the output voltage of a logic gate
is high (1) or low (0) will depend upon the
condition at its input. There are five common
logic gates, viz., the NOT gate, the AND gate,
the OR gate, the NAND gate, and the NOR
gate. Each logic gate is indicated by a symbol
and its function is defined by a truth table. A
truth table shows all possible combinations
of the input and corresponding outputs. The
truth table defines the function of a logic gate.
Truth tables help understand the behaviour of
a logic gate. All logic gates can be analysed by
constructing a truth table. The mathematical
statement that provides the relationship
between the input and the output of a logic gate
is called a Boolean expression. We will study
these basic logic gates at an elementary level.
16.5.1 NOT Gate :
This is the most basic logic gate. It has
one input and one output. It produces a ‘high’
output or output ‘1’ if the input is ‘0’. When
the input is ‘high’ or ‘1’, its out put is ‘low’
or ‘0’. That is, it produces a negated version
of the input at its output. This is why it is also

Logic Gates
In XIth Std. we studied continuously
varying signal (voltage or current). These
are is called analog signals. For example,
a sinusoidal voltage is an analog signal
Fig. 16.26 (a). In an analog electronic circuit,
the output signal varies continuously according
to the input signal.
A signal (voltage or current) which can
have only two discrete values is called a
digital signal. For example, a square wave
is a digital signal Fig. 16.26 (b). In digital
circuit, the output voltage can have only two

16.5.2 OR Gate:
An OR gate has two or more inputs and
one output. It is also called logical addition.
The output Y is 1 or high when either input
A or input B or both are 1, that is, if any one
of the input is high or both inputs are high, the
output is ‘1’ or high. The symbol and the truth
table for an OR gate are shown in Fig. 16.28.

16.5.5 NOR Gate:
The NOR gate is formed by connecting
the output of a NOT gate to the input of an
OR gate. The output of a NOR gate is exactly
opposite to that of an OR gate. The output Y
of a NOR gate is high or 1 only when both
the inputs are low or 0. The symbol and truth
table for NOR gate is given in Fig. 16.31. The
Boolean expression for a NOR gate is:

An AND gate has two or more inputs and
one output. The AND operation represents a
logical multiplication. The output Y of AND
gate is high or 1 only when input A and input B
are both 1 or both are high simultaneously. The
logic symbol and truth table for this gate are
given in Fig. 16.29. The Boolean expression
for an AND gate is :
Y=A∙B
16.5.4 NAND Gate:
The NAND gate is formed by connecting
the output of a NOT gate to the input of an
AND gate. The output of a NAND gate is
exactly opposite to that of an AND gate. If the
inputs A and B are both high or ‘1’, the output
Y is negation, i.e., the output is low or ‘0’. The
gate derives its name from this NOT-AND
behaviour. Figure 16.30 shows the symbol and
the truth table of a NAND gate. The Boolean
expression for a NAND gate is:

Output Y

NAND gate and NOR gate are called
Universal Gates because any gate can be
implemented by the combination of NAND
gates or NOR gates.

16.5.6 Exclusive OR/ X-OR Gate :
The Exclusive-OR logic function is a very
useful circuit that can be used in many different
types of computational circuits. The ability of
the Exclusive-OR gate to compare two logic
levels and produce an output value dependent
upon the input condition is very useful in
computational logic circuits. The output of an
Exclusive-OR gate goes 'HIGH' only when its
two input terminals are at different logic levels
with respect to each other. An odd number of
high or '1' at its input gives high or '1' at the
output. These two inputs can be at high level
('1') or at low level ('0') giving us the Boolean
expression:
C = (A  B) = A  B  A  B
