NATIONAL ANTHEM

Preface
Dear Students,
We welcome you all to Std. XII. Now you are familiar to the subject of Biology as a separate
discipline in standard XI. You have already been acquainted with many concepts of Biological
Sciences from Standard six onwards, especially in the subject of General Science up to standard
Eight and Science and Technology for standard Nine and Ten.
This textbook aims to create awareness about the biological sciences specially Botany,
Zoology and allied aspects of biological sciences. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF)
was formulated in 2005, followed by the State Curriculum Framework (SCF) in 2010. Based on
the given these two frameworks, reconstruction of the curriculum and preparation of a revised
syllabus has been undertaken which will be introduced from the academic year 2019-20. The
textbook incorporating the revised syllabus has been prepared and designed by the Maharashtra
State Bureau of Textbook Production and Curriculum Research, (Balbharati), Pune.
The subject biology intends to give students understanding, and appreciation of the vast diversity
of living beings, their special adaptations to their environments and evolutionary relationships. No
compromise is made in any manner over the use of language in the Biology context, but at the
same time, the textbook is presented in a simple licid language. In addition, relevant diagrams,
graphs, tables used in the textbook will bring about more clarity in the understanding of various
terminologies and biological concepts. All the illustrations are in colour form. This will surely
enable students to understand various concepts of botany and zoology thoroughly and correlate this
with their day-to-day practical life. The new syllabus focuses on the conceptual principles of overall
life processes, its understanding, and application in day-to-day life and ability to solve different
upcoming problems and issues like inheritance and its significance, conservation; different diseases
and remedies, the application of technology, etc. The general teaching-learning objectives of the
revised syllabus are further determined based on the ‘principle of constructivism’ i.e. self-learning.
The curriculum and syllabus confirms to the maxims of teaching such as moving from
concrete to abstract, known to unknown and from part to whole. For the first time, in the syllabus
of biology various independent activities have been introduced. These activities will not only help
to understand the content knowledge but also provide scope for gaining relevant and additional
application based knowledge on your own efforts. Q. R. Code have been introduced for gaining the
additional information, abstracts of chapters and practice questions/ activities.
The efforts taken to prepare the textbook will not only enrich the meaningful learning experience
of the students, but also benefit other stakeholders such as teachers, parents as well as those aspiring
candidates preparing for the competitive examinations.
We look forward to a positive response from the teachers and students.
Our best wishes to all!

Reproduction in Lower and Higher Plants
ii. Budding : It is the most common method
of asexual reproduction in unicellular
Yeast. Usually it takes place during
favourable conditions by producing one
or more outgrowths (buds). These buds on
seperation develop into new individual.
iii. Spore formation : In Chlamydomonas
asexual reproduction occurs by flagellated,
motile zoospores which can grow
independently into new individuals.

Can you recall?
1. How do plants reproduce without seeds ?
2. How does vegetative propagation occur
in nature ?
Reproduction is the production of young
ones like parents. Reproduction is an essential
process as it leads to continuation of species as
well as to maintain the continuity of life. Each
organism has its own particular method of
reproduction. All these methods generally fall
into two categories :
i. Asexual reproduction
ii. Sexual reproduction.

Zoospores

1.1 Asexual Reproduction :
Asexual reproduction does not involve
fusion of two compatible gametes or sex cells.
It is the process resulting in the production of
genetically identical progeny from a single
organism and inherits the genes of the parent.
Such morphologically and genetically identical
individuals are called clones. Organisms
choose to reproduce asexually by different
modes or ways:
i. Fragmentation : Multicellular organisms
can break into fragments due to one or
the other reasons. e.g. Spirogyra. These
fragments grow into new individuals.

Parent cell
(Zoosporangium)

Fig. 1.2 : Zoospores in Chlamydomonas
Other methods of asexual reproduction
include - Binary fission which occurs in
Amoeba, Paramoecium; Conidia formation
in Penicillium and Gemmules formation in
Sponges.

Activity :
Sprinkle a small spoonful of yeast over a
warm water and then add sugar. Cover it and
wait for 10 minutes. Yeast becomes bubbly
over the water proving that it is still active.
Can you recall?

Chain of buds

The capacity to reproduce by vegetative
propagation :
• Root - Sweet potato, Asparagus, Dahlia.
• Leaf - Bryophyllum, Kalanchoe, Begonia,
etc.
• Stem - rhizome (turmeric), tubers (potato),
bulbs (onion), etc.
• How does vegetative propagation occur
in nature?

Vegetative Reproduction :

carefully grown to give many plant lets.
Micropropagation method is also used now
a days.
1.2 Sexual Reproduction :
It involves fusion of two compatible
gametes or sex cells. All organisms reach to the
maturity in their life before they can reproduce
sexually. In plants, the end of juvenile or
vegetative phase marks the begining of the
reproductive phase and can be seen easily in
the higher plants at the time of flowering.
The flower is specialized reproductive
structure of a plant in which sexual reproduction
takes place. The function of flower is to produce
haploid gametes and to ensure that fertilization
will take place. Typical flower consists of four
different whorls viz. calyx, corolla androecium
and gynoecium.
Sexual reproduction involves two major
events viz. meiosis and fusion of gametes
to form diploid zygote and the production of
genetically dissimilar offsprings. Variations
are useful from the point of view of the survival
and the evolution of species, over the time.
Sexual reproduction is characterised
by fusion of the male and female gametes
(fertilization), the formation of zygote and
embryogenesis. Sequential events that occur
in sexual reproduction are grouped into three
distinct stages viz, Pre-fertilization, Fertilization
and the Post-fertilization.

Plants reproduce asexually through their
vegetative parts. Hence, the new plants formed
are genetically identical to their parents.
There are also few methods which would
not occur naturally in the plants. Agriculture
and horticulture exploit vegetative reproduction
in order to multiply fresh stocks of plants.
Artificial methods are used to propagate desired
varieties according to human requirements.
The various methods are as follows :
a. Cutting :
The small piece of any vegetative part
of a plant having one or more buds is used
for propagation viz. Stem cutting - e.g. Rose,
Bougainvillea; leaf cutting - e.g. Sansvieria;
root cutting e.g. Blackberry.
b. Grafting :
Here parts of two plants are joined in
such a way that they grow as one plant. In
this method, part of the stem containing more
than one bud (Scion) is joined onto a rooted
plant called stock, is called grafting. Whereas
budding is also called bud grafting in which
only one bud is joined on the stock, e.g. Apple,
Pear, Rose, etc.

Always Remember
Diploid

is
the
predominant plant body in all angiosperms,
where meiosis takes place to produce haploid
spores that form gametophyte. Gametophytes
are considerably reduced and develop within
the flower. They produce gametes.

Epidermis
Middle layers
Tapetum

Sporogenous
tissue

The male reproductive whorl of flower
is called androecium. Individual member of
androecium, is called stamen. Stamen consists
of filament, connective and anther.

Endothecium

Fig. 1.4 : (a) T. S. of anther

Structure of Anther :
An immature stage of anther is represented
by group of parenchymatous tissue surrounded
by single layered epidermis. Anther is
generally dithecous (having two lobes) and
tetrasporongiate. Each monothecous anther
contains two pollen sacs. In dithecous anther
four pollen sacs are present. Therefore, it
is tetrasporongiate. The heterogenesity
(differenciation) arises when some hypodermal
cells get transformed into archesporial cells.

Pollen grains

Fig. 1.4 : (b) Dehisced anther
1.3 Microsporogenesis :
Each microspore mother cell divides
meiotically to form tetrad of haploid
microspores (pollen grains).
Structure of microspore :
Typical pollen grain is a non-motile,
haploid, unicellular body with single nucleus.
It is surrounded by a two layered wall called
sporoderm. The outer layer exine is thick
and made up of complex, non-biodegradable,
substance called sporopollenin. It may
be smooth or with a sculptured pattern
(characteristic of the species). It is resistant to
chemicals. At some places exine is very thin
showing thin areas known as germ-pores.
These are meant for the growth of emerging
pollen tube during germination of pollen grain.
The inner wall layer, intine consists of cellulose
and pectin.

T. S. of Anther :
The archesporial cell divides into an inner
sporogenous cell and outer primary parietal
cell. Sporogenous cell forms sporogenous
tissue. Each cell of sporogenous tissue is
capable of giving rise to a microspore tetrad.
Parietal cell undergoes divisions to form anther
wall layers. The wall of mature anther consists
of four layers. Epidermis is the outermost
protective layer made up of tabular (flattened)
cells. Endothecium is sub-epidermal layer
made up of radially elongated cells with
fibrous thickenings. Inner to endothecium is
middle layer made up of thin walled cells (1-2
layered), which may disintegrate in mature
anther. Tapetum is the inner most nutritive
layer of anther wall. It immediately encloses
the sporogenous tissue (microspore mother
cells).

preserved as fossil?

Female reproductive whorl of flower is
gynoecium (Pistil). Individual member of
gynoecium is called carpel (megasporophyll).
A flower with many, free carpels is called
apocarpous (e.g. Michelia). A syncarpous
flower is one that has many carpels fused
together (e.g. Brinjal). Typical carpel has three
parts viz, ovary, style and stigma. The number
of ovules in the ovary varies e.g. paddy, wheat
and mango are uniovulate whereas tomato
and lady’s finger are multiovulate.

Always Remember
•

Pollen viability (viability is the functional
ablity of pollen grain to germinate to
develop male gametophyte) depends upon
environmental conditions of temperature
and humidity. It is 30 minutes in rice and
wheat. But in some members of family
Solanaceae, Rosaceae, Leguminosae, it
lasts even for months.

Development of male gametophyte :
Pollen grain marks the begining of
male gametophyte. It undergoes first mitotic
division to produce bigger, naked vegetative
cell and small, thin walled generative cell.
The vegetative cell is rich in food and having
irregular shaped nucleus. The generative cell
floats in the cytoplasm of vegetative cell.

1.4 Structure of Anatropous ovule :
Each ovule develops inside the ovary and
is attached to the placenta by a small stalk
called funiculus. The place of attachment of
funiculus with the main body of ovule, is called
hilum. In angiosperms, the most common type
of ovule is anatropous in which micropyle is
directed downwards and is present adjacent to
the funiculus (funicle). The ovule consists of
central parenchymatous tissue, the nucellus
which is surrounded usually by two protective
coverings called integuments viz. Outer and
an inner integument.
A narrow opening at the apex of the ovule
is called micropyle. Chalaza is the base of
ovule directly opposite to micropyle. Embryo
sac (female gametophyte) is oval multicellular
structure embedded in the nucellus.

stage in most of the angiosperms.

Antipodal cells are group of three cells
present at the chalazal end. The two haploid
polar nuclei of large central cell fuse to form
diploid secondary nucleus or definitive
nucleus, just prior to fertilization. This sevencelled and eight nucleated structure is called
an embryo sac. This method of embryo
sac development from a single megaspore
is described as monosporic development.
In angiosperms, the development of female
gametophyte is endosporous i.e. within the
megaspore. Female gametophyte is colourless,
endosporic and is concealed in the ovule
enclosed by ovary.

1.5 Megasporogenesis :
It is the process of formation of haploid
megaspores from diploid megaspore mother
cell (MMC). Megaspore mother cell becomes
distinguished in the nucellus, more or less in
the centre but towards micropylar end of ovule.
Development of female gametophyte :
Megaspore mother cell undergoes
meiosis to form linear tetrad of haploid cells
i.e. megaspore. Upper three megaspores abort
and lowest one towards centre of nucellus
remains functional. It acts as the first cell of
female gametophyte. Generally one megaspore
towards centre is functional megaspore. It is
infact the first cell of female gametophyte.
It undergoes three successive, free nuclear
mitotic divisions. Thus total eight nuclei are
formed, four of which are located at each pole.
One nucleus from each pole migrates towards
the centre and are called polar nuclei. Three
nuclei towards micropylar end constitute egg
apparatus. It consists of large central, haploid
egg cell and two supporting haploid synergid
cells. Synergid shows hair like projections
called filiform apparatus, which guide the
pollen tube towards the egg.

1.6 Pollination :
Pollen grains being non motile, angiosperms
have evolved the strategy to use abiotic agents
(wind, water) and biotic agents (birds, insects,
snails) to their flowers, feeding the visitors
and exploiting their mobility for pollination
and also seed dispersal. Pollen grains are
non-motile and they are usually carried from
flower to flower by means of external agents.
Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from
anther to the stigma of the flower. It is the prerequisite for fertilization because both the male
and female gametes are non-motile. Moreover
gametes are produced at two different sites.
5

Self pollination is a type of pollination
which occurs in a single flower or two flowers
on a single plant. It results in inbreeding or
selfing. In contrast cross pollination is the
transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of another flower of
different plants of same species. Pollination
can be further divided into three types on the
basis of source of pollination.

b. Geitonogamy :
It is the transfer of pollen grain to a stigma
of a different flower produced on the same plant.
It is functionally similar to cross pollination
as it involves pollinating agents, but it cannot
bring about genetic variations and is only of
ecological significance e.g. Cucurbita maxima.
It is similar to antogamy as pollen grains come
from same plant.

a. Autogamy (self pollination) :
It is a type of pollination in which bisexual
flower is pollinated by its own pollen grains.
Offsprings are genetically identical to their
parents e.g. pea.

c. Xenogamy (cross polination/ out
breeding) :
It is a type of cross pollination when pollen
grain of one flower is deposited on the stigma
of a flower of different plant belonging to same
species, with the help of pollinating agency. It
generates genetically varied offsprings.
Majority of flowering plants depend on
the transfer of pollen grains. Virtually all seed
plants need to be pollinated. Most of the food
and fibre crops grown throughout the world,
depend upon pollinators for reproduction.
The agents responsible for pollination have
been grouped into two main categories :
A. Abiotic agents
B. Biotic agents

Always Remember
•

•
•

•

•

•

Flowers which use autogamy consist of
several adaptations in the structure of a
flower to facilitate this process. It occurs
without external pollinating agents.
When flower opens to expose its sex
organs, it is called Chasmogamous.
The contrivances (a condition that leads
to) favour self pollination are- Bisexuality,
Homogamy and Cleistogamy.
Homogamy : When anther and stigma of
a flower become mature at the same time,
called homogamy.
Some flowers are self pollinated
even before the opening of flower.
Such condition is called cleistogamy.
Underground flowers in some plants
which exhibit cleistogamy are never
opened e.g. Commelina benghalensis.
Plants like Viola, Commelina can produce
both chasmogamous and cleistogamous
flowers on the same plant.

A. Abiotic Agents : These are non-living
agents which include wind and water.
1. Pollination by wind (Anemophily) :
Most of the important crop plants are
wind pollinated. These includes wheat, rice,
corn, rye, barley and oats. Palms are also wind
pollinated.
Adaptations in anemophilous flowers :
• The flowers are small, inconspicuous,
colourless, without nectar and fragrance
(odour).
• The pollen grains are light in weight, dry
and produced in large numbers to increase
chances of pollination considering wastage
of pollengrains.
• Stigma is feathery to trap pollens carried
by wind currents.

Think about it

grass) the pollen grains are long, ribbon like
and without exine.
Epihydrophily : The pollen grains float on
the water surface and reach the stigma of
female flower. e.g. Vallisneria is a submerged
dioecious, fresh water aquatic plant in which
female flowers reach the water surface
temporarily to ensure pollination and male
flowers float on the surface of water.
• Specific gravity of pollen grain is equal
to that of water. That is why they float on
surface of water.
• Some aquatic plants are anemophilous e.g.
Potamogeton, Halogaris, etc.
• Some aquatic plants are entomophilous e.g.
Lotus, water hyacinth, waterlily, etc.

2. Pollination by water (Hydrophily) :
Found only in some 30 genera of
aquatic monocots. E.g. Vallisneria, Zostera,
Ceratophyllum etc.
Adaptations in hydrophilous flowers :
• Flowers are small and inconspicuous.
• Perianth and other floral parts are
unwettable.
• Pollen grains are long and unwettable due
to presence of mucilage.
• Nectar and fragrance are lacking in
flowers.

Fig. 1.9 : Male and female plant Vallisneria
B. Biotic Agents : It includes living agents.
About 80% of plants require the help of other
living, moving creatures such as insects, birds,
bats, snails to transfer their pollens from one
flower to another. These also sustain our
ecosystems and produce natural resources by
helping plants to reproduce.
1. Pollination by insects (Entomophily) :
It occurs in Rose, Jasmine, Cestrum, etc.
Adaptations in entomophilous flowers :
• They are large, showy and often brightly
coloured.
• The flowers produce sweet odour (smell)
and have nectar glands.

Hydrophily is of two types Hypohydrophily : Pollination occurs below
the surface of water. Here the pollen grains are
heavier than water, sink down and caught by
stigmas of female flowers, e.g. In Zostera (sea

•

The stigma is rough due to presence of hair
or is sticky due to mucilaginous secretion.

•

The pollen grains are spiny and surrounded
by a yellow sticky substance called pollenkit.

•

Some plants have special adaptations
for the insect visitor to help in cross
pollination, e.g. lever mechanism or turnpipe mechanism in Salvia.

Fig. 1.11 : Ornithophily
Adaptations in ornithophilous flowers :
• Flowers are usually brightly coloured,
large and showy.
• They secrete profuse, dilute nectar.
• Pollen grains are sticky and spiny.
• Flowers are generally without fragrance,
as birds have poor sense of smell.
3. Pollination by Bats (Chiropteryphily) :
Bats can transport pollens over long
distance, some times several kilometers.

Do you know ?
In biotic pollination, plants are
adapted to encourage the specific pollinators
they need. They are said to have developed
pollination contrivance. Plants and pollinators
have co-evolved physical characteristics that
make them to interact successfully. Such
characteristics are considered pollination
syndromes.

Adaptations in Chiropterphilous flowers :
• Flowers are dull coloured with strong
fragrance.
• They secrete abundant nectar.
• Flowers produce large amount of edible
pollen grains, e.g. Anthocephalous
(kadamb tree), Adansonia (Baobab tree),
Kigelia (Sausage tree).
1.7 Outbreeding devices (contrivances):
Many plants have mechanisms that
discourage or prevent self pollination. To
promote cross pollination and increase genetic
diversity, plants have evolved a wide variety
of sexual strategies. Genetic diversity is
an essential factor for evolution by natural
selection. Continued self pollination results in
the inbreeding depression.
Thus plants have developed many devices
to encourage cross pollination. The examples
of outbreeding devices are as follows:

Fig. 1.10 : Lever mechanism in Salvia
Think about it
You may see bumblebee early in
the year as they try to find a suitable place
to establish a nest and rear a colony. If you
find a bumblebee nest please leave it alone.
Their nest lasts only for a season. Educate the
world about the need to help the bees.
2. Pollination by birds (Ornithophily) :
Only a few types of birds are specialised
for pollination. They usually have small size
and long beaks e.g. Sun birds and humming
birds. Some ornithophilous plants are Bombax,
Callistemon (Bottle Brush), Butea, etc.

Unisexuality :
In this case, the plant bears either male or
female flowers. It is also called as dioecism.
As flowers are unisexual, self pollination is
8

1.8 Pollen - Pistil Interaction :
It is the interaction of pollen grains with
sporophytic tissue (stigma). It begins with
pollination and ends with fertilization. All
the events from the deposition of pollen grain
on stigma to the entry of pollen tube in the
ovule (synergid) are referred as pollen - pistil
interaction. Pollination does not guarantee the
transfer of right type of pollen, often wrong type
also land on stigma. The pistil has the ability
to recognise and accept the right or compatible
pollen of the same species. Thus wrong type
of pollen is discarded by pistil. Compatibility
and incompatibility of the pollen-pistil is
determined by special proteins. This process
involves pollen recognition followed by
promotion or inhibition of pollen.
The stigmatic surface of flower refuse
other wrong type or incompatible pollen
grains. A physiologial mechanism operates to
ensure that only intraspecific pollen germinate
successfully. The compatible pollen absorbs
water and nutrients from the surface of stigma,
germinates and produces pollen tube. Its growth
through the style is determined by specific
chemicals. The stigmatic surface provides
the essential prerequisites for a successful
germination, which are absent in the pollen.
The pollen tube is finally pushed through the
ovule and reaches the embryo sac. The tip of
the pollen tube enters in one of the synergids
and then ruptures to release the contents. Due
to pollen pistil interaction, intense competition
develops even in the compatible pollen grains
(gametes).
It also plays important role in sexual
reproduction and seed formation. Pollen grain
can also be induced to germinate in a synthetic
medium. Sucrose induces pollen germination
and tube growth in vitro. Addition of boric acid
facilitates and accelarates pollen germination.

not possible. Plants may be monoecious, e.g.
Maize or dioecious, e.g. Mulberry, Papaya.
Dichogamy :
In this device, anthers and stigmas mature
at different times in a bisexual flower so as
to prevent self pollination. It can be further
divided into two types:
1. Protandry : In this type, androecium
matures earlier than the gynoecium, e.g. in
the disc florets of sunflower.
2. Protogyny : In this type, gynoecium matures
earlier than the androecium, e.g. Gloriosa.
Prepotency :
Pollen grains of other flowers germinate
rapidly over the stigma than the pollen grains
from the same flower, e.g. Apple.
Heterostyly (heteromorphy):
In some plants like Primula (Primrose,
there are two or three forms/ types of flowers
in which stigmas and anthers are placed at
different levels (heterostyly and heteroanthy).
This prevents the pollens from reaching the
stigma and pollinating it. In heteromorphic
flowers, pollen grains produced from anther
pollinate stigmas produced at the same level.
Herkogamy :
It is a mechanical device to prevent self
pollination in a bisexual flower. In plants,
natural physical barrier is present between
two sex organs and avoid contact of pollen
with stigma of same flower, e.g. Calotropispentangular stigma is positioned above the
level of anthers (pollinia).
Self incompatibility (self sterility):
This is a genetic mechanism due to which
the germination of pollen on stigma of the same
flower is inhibited, e.g. Tobacco, Thea.
Do you know ?

Artificial hybridization :
It is one of the major approaches used
in the crop improvement. Only the desired

In all breeding programmes, the plants
are hand pollinated to ensure cross pollination
between selected varieties. e.g. wheat, rice.

vacuole appears in the centre of cell pushing
the nuclei towards the periphery. Later, walls
develop between the nuclei, hence multicellular
endosperm is formed. But in several cases
cell wall formation remains incomplete. e.g.
wheat, sunflower and coconut. Coconut has
multicellular endosperm in the outer part and
free nuclear as well as vacuolated endosperm
in the centre.

• The triploid PEN develops into nutritive
endosperm tissue.
• It restores the diploid condition by fusion of
haploid male gamete with haploid female
gamete (i.e. through syngamy).
• It also helps to avoid polyembryony.
1.10 Development of Endosperm :
The triploid primary endosperm nucleus
repeatedly divides, mitotically to form nutritive
tissue, called endosperm. In post-fertilization
changes within the ovule, the embryo and
endosperm are seen to develop simultaneously.
The other cells of embryo sac disorganized
sooner or later. The formation of triploid
endosperm nucleus triggers cell division which
leads to the formation of endosperm.

b. Cellular Type :
In some plants, division of triploid primary
endospermic nucleus is immediately followed
by wall formation. So that the endosperm is
cellular right from the beginning. It is mostly
observed in 72 families of dicots as in members
- Balsam, Petunia, Adoxa, etc.

c. Helobial Type :
It occurs in the order Helobiales of
monocotyledons. In this case, first divison
of primary endosperm nucleus is followed
by a transverse wall, which divides the cell
unequally. The smaller cell is called chalazal
cell and larger cell is the micropylar cell. Then
the nuclei in each cell divide by free nuclear
divisions and then walls develop between
nuclei in micropylar chamber. It is intermediate
between cellular and nuclear type endosperm

cotyledons. The hypophysis by further division
gives rise to the part of radicle and root cap.
Subsequently, the cells in the upper tier of octant
divide in several planes so as to become heart
shaped which then forms two lateral cotyledons
and a terminal plumule. Further enlargement of
hypocotyl and cotyledons result in a curvature
of embryo and it appears horse-shoe shaped.
The embryo development is similar in both
dicots and monocots up to the octant stage. The
difference appears later. In monocot embryo,
single cotyledon occupies terminal position
and plumule is lateral. The single shield shaped
cotyledon is called as scutellum. The protective
sheath of plumule is called coleoptile and
that of radicle is coleorhiza. Finally, ovule is
transformed into the seed and ovary into the
fruit.

Fig. 1.18 : Maize seed (Monocot)
Seed sometimes consists of two distinct
coverings, a typical outer seed coat, the testa
and the inner thin, membranous tegmen.
The nucellus in the ovule may persist in
some genera like black pepper and beet as a
thin, papery layer, the perisperm. In some
seeds, the food reserves in the endosperm
are partially used up in the development
of an embryo. Obviously, in such seeds the
endosperm remains conspicuous and fills a
greater part of the seed. Thus, the resultant seed
is endospermic or albuminous e.g. Castor,
Coconut, Maize, etc.
In other seeds, embryo absorbs food
reserve from the endosperm completely during
its developmental stages. Thus, endosperm
disappears (disorganizes) in mature seeds.
The resultant seed is non-endospermic or exalbuminous e.g. Pea, bean, etc.
The cotyledons in some non-endospermic
seeds act as a food storage and in others they
are the first photosynthetic organs. Micropyle
persists as a small pore in seed coat to allow
the entry of water and oxygen during soaking.

1.12 Seed and Fruit Development :
The goal of reproduction, in every living
organisms including plants, is to create
offsprings for the next generation. One of the
ways that plants can produce offpsrings is by
forming (making) seeds. The flowers must be
pollinated in order to produce seeds and fruit.
Seed development is initiated by fertilization.
The integuments of the fertilized ovule persist
and get transformed into the seed coat of
mature seed.
Epicotyl
Hypocotyl

Fruit development is triggered by hormones
produced by developing seeds. As mentioned
earlier, after fertilization the zygote is formed
and the ovary begins to differentiate into the
fruit and ovary wall develops into pericarp.
Pericarp is basically three layered which get
differentiated in the fleshy fruit like mango,
coconut, etc.

1.13 Apomixis :
It is phenomenon of formation of embryo(s)
through asexual method of reproduction
without formation of gametes and the act of
fertilization. Alternatively, it is unusual sexual
reproduction where there is no meiosis and
syngamy. Embryo develops in the ovule and
ovule developes to form seed .
In apomixis, when a gametophyte organ
or cell produces embryo like structure without
fertilization, it is termed as apogamy. Similarly
when diploid sporophyte cell produces a diploid
gametophyte without undergoing meiosis is
called apospory, e.g. Orange, Mango.

Can you recall?
1. What are the parts of the fruit ?
2. What is the difference between true fruit
and false fruit ?
Significance of seed and fruit formation :
• Fruits provide nourishment to the
developing seeds.
• Fruits protect the seeds in immature
condition.
• Seeds serve as important propagating
organs (units) of plant.
• Seeds and fruits develop special devices
for their dispersal and thus help in the
distribution of the species.

Mix seeds and potting soil together with dry
clay. Mould the mixture into small balls and
allow them to dry in sun. Throw the same at
places suitable for germination.

The main categories of apomixis are:
a. Recurrent apomixis :
In this type, the embryo sac generally rise
either from an archesporial cell or from some
other part of the nucellus. In diplospory, the
unreduced embryo sac is derived from the
diploid megaspore mother cell e.g. Taraxacum.
In apospory, the nucellar cells give rise to
apomictic embryo sac.

Dormancy is a state of metabolic arrest that
facillitates the survival of organisms during
adverse environmental conditions. Structural or
physiological adaptive mechanism for survival
is called dormancy. Mature and viable seeds
will not germinate even in the presence of
favourable conditions and they are dispersed at
different places during dormancy. Viable seeds
germinate only after completion of dormancy
period.

b. Non-recurrent apomixis :
In this type, megaspore mother cell
undergoes usual meotic division and a haploid
embryo sac is formed. Here, the embryo arises
either from the egg by parthenogenesis or from
some other haploid cells of gametophyte through
apogamy. Plants produced by this method are
generally sterile and do not reproduce sexually,
e.g. Nicotiana.

Think about it
1. How long seeds stay viable/ healthy?
2. Can old seeds still grow?
Some examples of oldest mature seeds that
have grown into viable plants are as follows :
• Lupinus arcticus - 10,000 years
• Phoenix dactylifera - 2000 years
• Some seeds are short lived, e.g. Citrus.
• Some tiny seeds are easy for dispersal.
e.g. Striga, Orchids, Orobancha.

c. Adventive Embryony :
In this type, embryos may develop from
somatic nucellus or integuments along with
normal zygotic embryo. It is common in
Mango, Orange, Lemon, etc. It gives rise to a
condition called polyembryony.
14

Genetically identical plants can be
produced effectively and rapidly by apomixis.

Think about it
Why are some seeds of Citrus referred to
as polyembryonic ?

1.14 Parthenocarpy :
This term is coined by Noll (1902). It is the
condition in which fruit is developed without
the process of fertilization. It occurs naturally
in some varities of Pineapple, Banana, Papaya,
etc. In these plants, it seems that the placental
tissue in the unfertilized ovary produces auxin
IAA (Indole-3 Acetic Acid) which is responsible
for enlargement of ovary into fruit. The fruit
resembles the normally produced fruit but it is
seedless.

Do you know ?
1. Parthenogenesis is the development of
embryo directly from egg cell or a male
gamete. It is a kind of apogamy.
2. Agamospermy : Here plants produce
seeds. But embryo, inside it, is produced
without (omitting) meiosis and syngamy.
3. Parthenocarpy can be induced artificially
by - spraying of gibberellins, delaying
pollination, use of foreign pollens, etc.
4. Genetically uniform parental type
seedlings are obtained from nucellar
embryos.

1.15 Polyembryony :
It is the development of more than one
embryos, inside the seed and the condition
is described as polyembryony. It was first
noticed by Leeuwenhoek (1719) in the seeds
of Citrus genus. It is the occurrence of more
than one embryo in a seed which consequently
results in the emergence of multiple seedlings.
The additional embryos result from the
differentiation and development of various
maternal and zygotic tissues associated with
the ovule of seed. Polyembryony may be true
or false depending upon whether many embryos
arise in the same embryo sac or in different
embryo sacs in the same ovule. In adventive
polyembryony, an embryo develop directly
from the diploid cell of nucellus and integuments
as in Citrus. In cleavage polyembryony, zygote
proembryo sometimes divides (cleaves) into
many parts or units. Each unit then developes
into an embryo. Polyembryony increases
the chances of survival of the new plants.
Nucellar adventive polyembryony is of great
significance in horticulture.

Reproduction in Lower and Higher Animals
Gemmule Formation:
Gemmule is an internal bud formed only
in sponges. It has asexually produced mass or
aggregation of dormant cells, the archaeocytes
capable of developing into a new organism.
The archaeocytes get coated by a thick resistant
layer of secretion by amoebocytes. The
gemmule is formed to overcome unfavourable
conditions. On return of favourable conditions
of water and temperature, the gemmules
hatch and develop into a new individual. e.g.
Spongilla.

4. What are the different methods of
reproduction in animals?
We know that reproduction is one of the
major life processes of any living organism.
It helps in maintaining the continuity of the
species. Reproduction is defined as the
biological process of formation of new life
forms from pre-existing similar life. It thus
becomes a vital process which enables the
species to survive over a long period, even
though the individuals or organisms live
naturally for a limited period of time i.e. their
life span. In this chapter, we will learn about
the various methods of reproduction in animals
the human reproductive system, gametogenesis
and fertilization, early embryology, parturition
and reproductive health.
Reproduction in animals occurs mainly by
two methods i.e. asexual and sexual.

Budding:
It is a simple method of asexual
reproduction normally occuring in favourable
conditions. It is seen in a variety of animals
like coelenterates (Hydra and corals) and in
some colonial ascidians. In Hydra, a small
outgrowth is produced towards the basal end
of the body.

2.1 Asexual Reproduction in animals :
It is a common method among lower
animals. It does not involve meiosis nor the
gamete formation and fusion. The formation of
progeny is by a single parent only and does not
involve both the sexes, so it is called asexual
reproduction. The progeny or daughter cells
are genetically identical to the single parent
and are also referred to as clones. The lower
animals reproduce asexually by gemmule
formation and budding.

It develops as a bud which grows and
forms tentacles and develops (get transformed)
into a new individual. This process is called
budding. The young Hydra gets detached from
the parent and becomes an independent new
organism.

The sexually reproducing animals show
two main phases in their life time. The earlier
juvenile phase mainly represents physical
growth phase starting from birth. The animals
can not reproduce sexually in this phase.
The later Reproductive maturity phase
is attained usually after physical growth is
almost over. It involves growth and activity
of the sex organs. The animal can reproduce
sexually in this phase. Both these periods
(phases) are of variable duration in different
animals. After attaining sexual maturity,
the animal exhibits various events, namely
pre-fertilization (gametogenesis and gamete
transfer), fertilization (fusion of male and
female gametes) and post fertilization events
(formation of zygote and embryogenesis).

Do you know ?
Regeneration:
A word which in biology refers to the
process observed in all living organisms
from the unicellular bacteria upto the most
complex multicellular forms e.g. humans. By
this process, the organism can fundamentally
repair or regrow or restore its lost or damaged
part. Though it involves asexual processes,
it differs distinctly from reproduction e.g.
a damaged Hydra can regenerate its lost
part. Similarly Planaria if wounded, its cells
become active and regenerate lost part or
organ back to its original state. They can also
reproduce asexually by fragmentation. Also,
it is seen in planarians that the anterior end
exerts a pull on the posterior end resulting in
a constriction in the middle part and splitting
into two pieces. Each piece grows into a new
Planaria. i.e. two clones of the original have
been formed.

The sexually reproducing animals show
various breeding patterns. Some like the goat,
sheep, and donkey are seasonal breeders while
humans and apes are continuous breeders.
They can breed throughout the year.
Human Reproduction :
Humans are sexually reproducing animals.
The process of reproduction involves various
sequential steps such as gametogenesis,
insemination, internal fertilization (i.e. fusion
of male and female gametes), zygote formation
and embryogenesis, gestation and parturition.
The gametes, sperms and eggs are produced
by the primary sex organs, testis in male and
ovary in female. Organs other than testis and
ovary, are called secondary sex organs of the
male and female. As male and female can be
externally differentiated by certain specific
features called secondary sexual characters,
they are called sexual dimorphic characters.
In males, presence of beard, moustache,
hair on the chest, muscular body, enlarged
larynx (Adam’s apple) are secondary sexual
characters while in females these characters
are the developed breast, broader pelvis and
high pitched voice.

2.2 Sexual reproduction in animals :
It is the process which involves the
production of offspring by the formation and
fusion of gametes. It is also called amphimixis.
In animals, gamete formation primarily
involves meiosis.

Histology of Testis:
The testis is externally covered by a
collagenous connective tissue layer called
tunica albuginea. Outer to it is an incomplete
peritoneal covering called tunica vaginalis,
and inner to it is tunica vasculosa, a thin
membranous and vascular layer. Fibers from
tunica albuginea divide each testis into about
200-300 testicular lobules (refer dig. 2.3
L. S. of testis). Each with 1-4 highly coiled
seminiferous tubules. Each seminiferous
tubule is internally lined by cuboidal germinal
epithelial cells (spermatogonia) and few large
pyramidal cells called Sertoli or sustentacular
cells.

A. Male Reproductive System :
It consists of the primary male organ
(gonad) called testes, the accessory ducts
and glands which form internal and external
genitalia.

spermatocyte (2n), secondary spermatocyte
(n), spermatids (n) and sperms (n). The
Interstitial or Leydig’s cells lie in between the
seminiferous tubules. They secrete the male
hormone androgen or testosterone.

a. Testes:
A pair of testes, mesodermal in origin, are
formed in the lower abdominal cavity. They
are located in a pouch called scrotum. During
early foetal life, the testes develop in abdominal
cavity and later they descend into the scrotal
sac through a passage called inguinal canal.
Each testis is oval in shape, 4 to 5cm long, 2 to
3cm wide and 3cm thick.

c. Glands:
The male accessory glands are as follows:
• Seminal vesicles: It is a pair of glands lying
on the posterior side of urinary bladder.
It secretes an alkaline seminal fluid
which contains fructose, fibrinogen and
prostaglandins. It contributes about 60%
of the total volume of the semen. Fructose
provides energy for sperm movement while
fibrinogen coagulates the semen into a
bolus for quick propulsion in the vagina.
The prostaglandins stimulate reverse
peristalsis in vagina and uterus aiding
faster movement of sperms towards the egg
in the female body.
• Prostate gland: It is a large and single
gland made up of 20-30 lobes and is
located underneath the urinary bladder. It
surrounds the urethra and releases a milky
white and slightly acidic prostatic fluid into
the urethra. It forms about 30% of volume
of semen. It contains citric acid, acid
phosphatase and various other enzymes.
The acid phosphatase protects the sperms
from the acidic environment of vagina.

Do you know ?
1. Presence of the peritoneal covering
around the testis is an indication of its
abdominal origin.
2. The testis are suspended in the scrotum
by the spermatic cord.
3. Testosterone hormone stimulates the
descent of testis and the fibro-muscular
band called gubernaculum in the
scrotum.
4. In some males a loop of the intestine
may pass through the inguinal canal into
the scrotum and cause a condition called
inguinal hernia.
b. Accessory ducts:
The accessory ducts include rete testis,
vasa efferentia, epididymis, vas deferens,
ejaculatory duct and urethra. All the
seminiferous tubules of the testis at the
posterior surface form a network of tubules
called rete testis. 12-20 fine tubules arising
from rete testis are vasa efferentia. They carry
the sperms from the testis and open into the
epididymis. It is a long and highly coiled tube
which is differentiated into an upper caput-,
middle corpus- and lower cauda epididymis.
The sperms undergo maturation in epididymis.
Posteriorly it leads into the vas deferens which
travels upto the abdominal cavity and loops
over the ureter to open into the urethra. Before
doing so, it joins the duct of seminal vesicle
to form the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory
duct passes through the prostate gland and
opens into the urethra. The urethra provides
a common passage for the urine and semen
and hence is also called urinogenital duct. In
males the urethra is long and extends through
the penis. It opens to the outside by an opening
called the urethral meatus or urethral orifice.
All the accessory ducts except urethra are
present in pairs.

semen is given out during a single ejaculation
and it contains about 400 million sperms. It
contains secretion of the epididymis and the
accessory glands for nourishing (fructose),
neutralizing acidity (Ca++, bicarbonates),
activation for movement (prostaglandins).

d. External genitalia:
It includes the penis and the scrotum.
The penis is the male copulatory organ. It is
cylindrical and muscular with three bundles
of erectile tissue- a pair of postero-lateral
tissue called corpora cavernosa and a median
corpus spongiousm. The swollen tip of the
penis is called glans penis. It is covered by a
loose fold of skin called foreskin or prepuce.
Scrotum :
It is a loose pouch of pigmented skin
lying behind the penis and is divided into a
right and left scrotal sac by a septum of tunica
dartos made of smooth muscle fibres. The
foetal testes are guided into and retained in the
scrotum by a short fibro muscular band called
gubernaculum. The testes remain suspended
in scrotum by a spermatic chord. Failure
of testis to descend into scrotum is called
cryptorchidism. The failure also results in the
sterility. The cremaster and dartos muscles of
scrotum help in drawing testes close or away
from the body. This helps in maintaining the
temperature of the testis 2-30C lower than
the normal body temperature, necessary for
spermatogenesis.

1. Ovary : It is the primary female sex organ.
Its main function is production of egg or ovum
and the female reproductive hormones. It is
solid, oval or almond shaped organ. It is 3.0
cm in length, 1.5 cm in breadth and 1.0 cm
thick. It is located in the upper lateral part of
the pelvis near the kidneys. Each ovary is held
in position by ligaments by attaching it to the
uterus and the abdominal wall. The largest of
these is the broad ligament formed by a fold
of peritoneum. It holds the ovary, oviduct and
the uterus to the dorsal body wall. The ovarian
ligament attaches ovary to the uterus. The
ovary produces five hormones viz, estrogen,
progesteron, relaxin, activin and inhibin.
Structure and development of the ovary :
Each ovary is a compact structure
differentiated into a central part called medulla
and the outer part called cortex. The cortex
is covered externally by a layer of germinal

B. Female Reproductive System:
The female reproductive system consist of
the following parts :
22

The large scale destruction of the primordial
follicles during growth is called atresia.

epithelium. The stroma or loose connective
tissue of the medulla has blood vessels, lymph
vessels, and nerve fibres. The outer cortex is
more compact and granular. It shows large
number of tiny masses of cells called ovarion
follicles. These are collectively formed from
the immature ova originating from cells of
the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac. The cells
migrate to the gonadal ridge during embryonic
development and divide mitotically. Now
these cells are called oogonia. As the oogonia
continue to grow in size they are surrounded
by a layer of granulosa cells and form the
rudiments of the ovarian follicles. The process
of oogenesis starts much before the birth of the
female baby and by the end of twelve weeks
the ovary is fully formed. It has more than two
million primordial follicles in it.

The development of the primordial follicles
into mature or Graafian follicles restarts with
the onset of puberty. During each menstrual
cycle only one of the primordial follicle starts
growing to form the Graafian follicle.
In each cycle, alternately one of the two
ovaries produces the Graafian follicle.
The 1st menstrual cycle or menarche begins
normally at about 13 years and Menopause
i.e. stopping of the cycles happens at age 45
to 55 years. The period in between menarche
and menopause is the reproductive age of the
female and is approximately 32 years. In this
time the female will be producing a maximum
of about 416 eggs (32 ×13 = 416 eggs).
Ovarian histology of a mature female :
In the histology of ovary, we have
discussed the primary structure of ovary. The
following discussion includes the changes seen
in a mature ovary, primarily in the cortex. The
different stages of development of the oocyte
can be seen. These changes in the ovary are
cyclic, occuring during each menstrual cycle
and it involves maturation of the primordial
follicles into primary, secondary and Graafian
follicles. Each primary follicle has multilayered
cuboidal follicular cells. The stroma cells
add theca over the follicle. It now changes
into a secondary follicle. There is growth of
the oocyte and the granulosa cells increase
in number. They start producing the hormone
estrogen. The secondary follicle grows into the
Graafian follicle by addition of more follicular
cells. As this process of maturation of follicles
takes place, they begin to move towards the
surface of ovary. The Graafian follicle presses
against the thin wall of the ovary giving it a
blistered appearance. The egg is released from
the Graafian follicle during ovulation and
the remaining part of the follicle changes into
a temporary endocrine gland called corpus

The cells of germinal epithelium give

cortex in the form of cords called egg tubes of
Pfluger. Each cord at its end has a round mass
of oogonial cells called egg nests, from which
the primordial ovarian follicles develop. Each
primordial follicle has, at its center a large
primary oocyte (2n) surrounded by a single
layer of flat follicular cells. The primary oocyte
starts with its meiotic division but gets arrested
it at meiosis I. Of the two million primordial
follicles embedded in the foetal ovary only
about one million remain at birth and only
about 40,000 remain at the time of puberty.

b. Ampulla : It is the middle, long and
straight part of the oviduct. Fertilization of
the ovum takes place in this region.

Structure of Graafian follicle :
Graafian follicle is a mature ovarian
follicle. An eccentric secondary oocyte is
surrounded by a non-cellular layer of zona
pellucida secreted by the vitelline membrane
of oocyte. The outermost protective and fibrous
covering is called theca externa. Inner to it is
cellular theca interna. It produces the hormone
estrogen. Inner to the theca interna, the follicular
cells form the membrana granulosa. From the
membrana granulosa the cells differentiate
into discus proligerus and the corona radiata
cells. Cumulus oophorus is the term used for
the oocyte and surrounding granulosa cells . A
fluid filled cavity called antrum lies between
the oocyte and the membrana granulosa. It is
filled with a fluid called liquor folliculi.

3. Uterus : It is commonly also called the
womb. It is a hollow, muscular, pear shaped
organ, located above and behind the urinary
bladder. It is about 7.5 cm long, 5 cm broad
and 2.5 cm thick. The uterus can be divided
into three regions :
a. Fundus : It is the upper dome shaped part.
Normally implantation of the embryo
occurs in the fundus.
b. Body : It is the broad part of the uterus
which gradually tapers downwards.
c. Cervix : It is the narrow nec about 2.5 cm
in length. It extends into the vagina. Its
passage has two openings : an internal
os towards the body, and an external os
towards the vagina.

muscular
myometrium, made up of thick layer of
smooth muscles. Vigorous contractions of these
muscles cause labour during the parturition
(child birth). The innermost layer called
endometrium or mucosal membrane is made
up of stratified epithelium. The thickness of
this layer regularly undergoes changes in
during the menstrual cycle. It is richly supplied
with blood vessels and uterine glands. These
provide nourishment to the developing foetus.

proximal part of the tube lies close to the ovary,
and distally it opens into the uterus. Each tube
is 10 to 12 cm in length. It is internally lined by
ciliated epithelium. It can be divided into three
regions :

projection lying at the antirior end of labia
minora. It has a pair of erectile tissue - The
corpora cavernosa and is homologous to
the penis.

Uterus cancer:
Most of the uterine cancers begin
in the layer of cells that form the lining of
endometrium of uterus.
Symptoms : Abnormal bleeding between
periods, vaginal bleeding after menopause,
an abnormal watery, blood-tinged discharge
from vagina, pelvic pain.
Detection : It is diagnosed with Pap smear
test, biopsy, Ultrasound.
Treatment : Chemotherapy, radiation,
surgical removal of uterus (hysterectomy).

d. Labia majora - These are a pair a fleshy
folds of skin forming the boundary of vulva.
They are homologous to the scrotum. They
surround and protect the other parts of
external genitalia and enclose the urethral
and vaginal openings in the vestibule.
e. Mons pubis - It is a fleshy elevation above
the labia majora. The Mons pubis and outer
part of labia majora show pubic hair.

4. Vagina : It is a tubular, female copulatory
organ, 7 to 9 cm in length. It lies between the
cervix and the vestibule. The vaginal wall has
an inner mucosal lining, the middle muscular
layer and an outer adventitia layer. The mucosal
epithelium is stratified and non-keratinised
and stores glycogen. There are no glands but
the cervical secretion of mucus is recieved in
the vagina. The opening of the vagina into
the vestibule is called vaginal orifice. This
opening is covered partially by a fold of mucus
membrane called hymen. The vagina acts as
a passage for menstrual flow as well as birth
canal during parturition.

6. Accessary glands / Vestibular glands /
Bartholin’s glands : It is a pair of glands
homologous to the Bulbourethral or Cowper’s
glands of the male. They open into the vestibule
and release a lubricating fluid.
Mammary glands :
Accessory organs of female reproductive
system for production and release of milk after
parturition. Development of the mammary
gland occurs at puberty under the influence of
estrogen and progesteron. Lactotropic hormone
(LTH) or prolactin helps in development of
lactiferous tubules during pregnancy.

Puberty / Sexual maturity in Females :
The reproductive system becomes
functional at puberty. It is characterised
by onset of menstrual cycle also called
menarche, which usually occurs at age 1014 years. However, unlike in the males, the
mature females show cyclic changes in their
reproductive system- the menstrual cycles.
These cycles continue only upto menopause.
This normally happens at age 45-50 years. The
period from menarche to menopause is thus the
reproductive age of the female. The female is
unable to bear children (by natural method)
after menopause. Menarche, menstrual cycles
and menopause are controlled by gonadotropic
hormones.

2nd to 6th rib). These are modified sweat glands.
Each mammary gland contains fatty connective
tissue and numerous lactiferous ducts. The
glandular tissue of each breast is divided into
15-20 irregularly shaped mammary lobes,
each with alveolar glands and lactiferous duct.
Alveolar glands secrete milk which is stored
in the lumen of alveoli. The alveoli open into
mammary tubules. The tubules of each lobe
join to form a mammary duct. Many mammary
ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla,
which is connected to lactiferous duct. These
converge towards the nipple located near the
tip of the breast. It is surrounded by a dark
brown coloured and circular area of the skin
called areola.

2.3 Menstrual cycle (Ovarian cycle):
Menstrual cycle is the characteristic
feature of primates including human. It
involves a series of cyclic changes in the ovary
and the female reproductive tract, mainly in
the uterus. These changes take place under
the effect of gonadotropins and the ovarian
hormones respectively. The cycles are repeated
with a periodicity of approximately 28 days.
The middle of each cycle is characterised by
the release of an egg. This egg in every cycle
comes alternately from one of the two ovaries.
The cycle is divided into four phases.

a. Menstrual phase:
The begining of each cycle is taken as
the first day where menses or loss of blood
(45-100ml) takes place and it lasts for
approximately five days (average 3-7 days).
Endometrium of uterus breaks down
under the effect of prostaglandins released
due to decreased levels of progesteron and
estrogen. Due to this blood, tissue fluid, mucus,
endometrial lining and the unfertilized oocyte
is discharged through vagina. The endometrial
lining becomes very thin i.e. about 1 mm. The
menstrual discharge continues for an average
of 5 days, however this blood does not clot

Puberty / Sexual maturity in Males :
Puberty is the age at which the reproductive
system becomes functional, sex organs begin
to produce gametes and sex hormones. In
males the onset of puberty occurs at age 12-15
years. Under the influence of testosterone, the
secondary sexual characters appear. Thereafter
it remains functional throughout the life.

due to presence of fibrinolysin. Menstrual
phase occurs when an ovulated egg does not
get fertilized and it is thereby shed out along
with the menstrum. It is thus called ‘funeral of
unfertilized egg’.
During these five days, many primordial
follicles develope into primary and few of them
into secondary follicles under the effect of FSH.

of degeneration is called atresia. Developing
secondary follicles secrete the hormone
estrogen. The stimulation for proliferation of
new follicles is influenced by GnRH which
stimulates release of FSH.
Endometrium begins to regenerate under
the effect of gradually increasing quantity
of estrogens. Regeneration also involves
formation of endothelial cells, endometrial or
uterine glands and network of blood vessels.
Thickness of endometrium reaches 3-5 mm.

c. Ovulatary phase:
It is the shortest phase of menstrual cycle.
It involves rupturing of the mature graafian
follicle and release of ovum (secondary
oocyte) into the pelvic cavity; usually on 14th
day of menstrual cycle. Rapid secretion of LH
by positive feedback mechanism causes the
mature follicle to rupture. Ovulation may be
accompanied by mild or severe pains in lower
abdomen.

d. Secretory phase / Luteal phase:
Duration of this phase is between the
ovulation and beginning of the next menses.
This phase is the longest phase. It lasts for 14
days; from 15th to 28th day of the cycle.
After release of secondary oocyte,
remaining tissue of graafian follicle transforms
into corpus luteum under the effect of LH.
Corpus luteum begins to secrete progesteron
and estrogens. The ovulated egg may get
fertilized within 24 hours. However, in the
absence of fertilization, corpus luteum can
survive for only two weeks and then degenerate
into a white scar called corpus albicans.
The corpus luteum releases progesteron,
small amount of estrogens and inhibin.
Under the influence of these hormones, the
endometrial glands grow, become coiled and
start uterine secretions. Endometrium becomes
more vascularized and thickens up to 8-10 mm.
Inhibin stops secretion of FSH. These changes
are necessary for fertilization and subsequent
implantation.

which extends the life of corpus luteum and
stimulates it’s secretory activity. Presence of
hCG in maternal blood and urine is an indicator
of pregnancy. In absence of fertilization, next
menstrual cycle begins.

spermatogenesis. At the onset of puberty, the
hypothalamus begins secretion of gonadotropin
releasing hormone (GnRH). It initiates the
significant increase in the secretion of follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) which induces
spermatogenesis. Each seminiferous tubules
is lined by a single layer of cuboidal epithelial
cells called germinal epithelium.
The cells of germinal epithelium undergo
spermatogenesis to produce sperms. Process of
spermatogenesis involves three phases.

Hygiene practices during menstruation :
• Keep the pubic area clean.
• Change the sanitary napkin every 4-5
hours.
• Maintaining personal hygiene during
menstruation is important to reduce the
risk of infection.
• Dispose used sanitary napkin properly.
• Using damp and dirty clothes or using
a sanitary napkin for a longer time can
act as a perfect environment for growth
and multiplication of harmful bacteria
and lead to infections.

Can you tell the names of primates who
show the presence of menstrual cycle?

I. Multiplication phase: The primordial
germ cells (2n) of seminiferous tubules
undergo repeated mitotic divisions to produce
large number of spermatogonia (2n). Each
spermatogonium is diploid and with 46
chromsomes.

2.4 Gametogenesis:
The gametogenesis is the process of
formation of gametes in sexually reproducing
animals. The male gamete is sperm and the
female gamete is ovum or egg. The gametes are
formed from primordial germ cells of gonads.

II. Growth phase: Some of the spermatogonia
stop dividing and grow in size to develop
into primary spermatocytes (2n) due to
accumulation of food.

Spermatogenesis:
The process of formation of the male
gamete (sperm) or spermatozoa from the
germinal epithelium of testis is called
28

contains hydrolytic enzymes; hyaluronidase
and proteolytic enzymes like zona lysins and
corona penetrating enzymes.

III. Maturation phase: It involves meiotic or
reduction division. The spermatocyte undergoes
the first phase of meiotic division (meiosis
I) leading to formation of two haploid cells
called secondary spermatocytes (n), which are
with 23 chromosomes each. The secondary
spermatocyte undergoes second phase of
meiotic division (meiosis II) to produce four
haploid spermatids. The spermatid is nonmotile and non-functional. It gets transformed
into a functional spermatozoa by the process
called spermiogenesis. During this process of
change, the spermatids remain held to each
other and to the sertoli cells by cytoplasmic
bridges. The sperm heads remain attached to the
sertoli cells and their tails hanging in the lumen
of seminiferous tubule. During spermiogenesis,
length of spermatid increases. Centrioles are
rearranged as primary and distal centrioles.
Mitochondria become spirally coiled and
acrosome is formed from golgi complex.

Neck: It is a very short region having two
centrioles i.e. proximal centriole and distal
centriole.
Middle piece: It has an axial filament
surrounded by 10-14 spiral turns of
mitochondria (nebenkern). It produces energy
necessary for the movement of sperm.
Tail: It is a long, slender and tapering part
containing cytoplasm and fine thread- axial
filament. The axial filament arises from the
distal centriole and travels through out the
length of tail. It is partly surrounded by plasma
membrane (main piece). The part without
plasma membrane is called end piece.
Oogenesis:
It is process of formation of the haploid
female gamete i.e. egg or ovum from the diploid
germinal epithelium. It involves the process of
meiosis (and mitosis). Like spermatogenesis,
oogenesis process can be divided into three
stages :
I. Multiplication phase
II. Growth phase
III. Maturation phase

Structure of sperm:
Sperm is the male gamete. It is a motile,
microscopic elongated cell. It is divisible into
three parts- head, middle piece and tail.

meiosis II and completion of fertilization go
hand in hand. If the secondary oocyte does not
receive the sperm / spermatozoa, it is shed off
along with menstrum).

Activity :
Prepare a chart of comparison between
spermatogenesis and oogensesis.
I. Multiplication phase: In this stage, the
primary germinal cells PGCs (2n) of ovary
undergo repeated mitotic division to form
millions of gamete mother cells or oogonial
cells (2n). This process is completed in the
embryonic stage of human females.

Structure of secondary oocyte:
In human, unfertilized egg when ovulated
i.e. released from the ovary is actually the
secondary oocyte. It is non-cleidoic (without
shell) and microlecithal (yolk is present in very
small quantity). It is approximately 0.1mm (100
microns) in size. It is rounded, nonmotile and
haploid female gamete. The nucleus of the egg
appears large and is called germinal vesicle.
Typical nucleus or pronucleus is formed at the
time of fertilization. The cytoplasm of egg is
also called ooplasm. It is devoid of centrioles.
The egg is surrounded by various coverings.

II. Growth phase: Some of the oogonia stop
division and begin to increase in size and form
the primary oocytes (2n). Cellular organelles
like ER, golgi appratus and mitochondria
increase in number.
III. Maturation phase: Oogenesis takes place
in the ovaries. The process is initiated prior to
birth of the female baby. The primary oocytes
(2n) enter the maturation phase which includes
meiotic division (Meiosis I and Meiosis II).
The diploid primary oocytes undergo meiosis I
(reduction division) to form 2 haploid daughter
cells. This division is peculiar in females
as both the daughter cells are with haploid
number of chromosomes i.e. 23 chromosomes.
But due to unequal division of cytoplasm, of
the 2 daughter cells produced, one is a large
cell called secondary oocyte (n) and another is
a small cell called 1st polar body (n). Normally
the 1st polar body does not enter meiosis II.
The secondary oocyte (n) proceeds meiosis II,
only upto metaphase II. It’s division is further
stopped or arrested at this stage. The secondary
oocyte is shed from the graafian follicle and
ovary. The restart and completion of meiosis II
will happen only with entry of the sperm. This
last phase is usually completed in the ampulla
of the fallopian tube at the time of fertilization.
In this division also, the two unequal daughter
cells are formed- the large cell is ovum (n) and
the small cell is 2nd polar body (n). The ovum
(n) so formed functions as the female gamete

The egg membrane is called vitelline
membrane. It secretes a non-cellular
glycoproteinous membrane, zona pellucida
on its outside. Adhering to the outer surface of
zona pellucida are several radially elongated
cells forming the corona radiata. These
cells are derived from the innermost layer of
granulosa cells. They are firmly held to the
zona pellucida and to each other by hyaluronic
acid (mucopolysaccharide). Between the
vitelline membrane and the zona pellucida is
a fluid filled perivitelline space. The first polar
body lies in this space.

The egg shows polarity. The side having
germinal vesicle and first polar body is called
animal pole while the side opposite to it is
called vegetal pole.

Always Remember

2.5 Fertilization / Syngamy:
Sexual reproduction primarily involves
formation and fusion of gametes. Fertilization
is the later process which involves fusion of
the haploid male and female gametes resulting
in the formation of a diploid zygote (2n). Like
in other mammals, in humans the process of
fertilization is internal and it usually takes
place in the ampulla of the fallopian / uterine
tube. The fertilized egg or zygote will develop
into an embryo and this process occurs within
the uterus.

As a result of capacitation, sperms become
extra active and begin to start moving upwards
from vagina to uterus and to the oviducts.
The prostaglandins activate the sperms.
The vestibular secretions of the female also
enhance sperms motility. The sperms swim at
an average speed of 1.5 to 3.0 mm/min.

Sperm nucleus
1. After the sperm
penetrates the secondary
oocyte, the oocyte
completes meiosis II,
forming the ovum and
second polar body.

Sperms reach upto the ampulla as a result of
their own swimming and partly by contraction
of uterus and fallopian tubes stimulated by
oxytocin of female. After capacitation the
sperms may reach ampulla within 5 minutes.
Sperms can remain viable for 24-48 hours
(Ovum for about 24 hours).

2. Sperm and ovum
nuclei swell, forming
pronuclei.
3. Pronuclei approach
each other and mitotic
spindle forms between
them.

b. Entry of sperm into the egg : Out of 200 to
400 million sperms, only few hundred manage
to reach the ampulla. Though many sperms
reach the ampulla but only a single sperm
fertilizes the ovum. A sperm after reaching
the egg / ovum comes to lie against it. Its
acrosome releases lysins : hyaluronidase and
corona penetrating enzymes. They separate
and dissolve the cells of corona radiata, so the
sperm head passes through the zona pellucida
of egg. The zona pellucida has fertilizin
receptor proteins (ZP3, ZP2). The fertilizin
binds to specific acid protein- antifertilizin
of sperm. It brings about attraction of sperms
to the egg to enhance fertilization. Fertilizinantifertilizin interaction is species specific.
Thus, the fertilizin-antifertilizin reaction is also
called compatibility reaction.

Fig. 2.13 : Process of Fertilization
Mechanism of fertilization :
Semen released during ejaculation has sperms
and some secretions. The coagulated semen
now undergoes liquification and sperms
become active. The mechanism of fertilization
is as follows :
a. Movement of sperm towards egg :
It involves capacitation of sperms
reaching the vagina. Here as many as 50% are
demotilised / broken / destroyed. Remaining
sperms undergo capacitation. This process
requires 5-6 hours. Acrosome membrane
31

Acrosome reaction : As the sperm head touches
the zona pellucida in the animal pole region,
its acrosome covering ruptures to release lytic
enzymes, acrosin or zona lysin. They act on
the zona pellucida at the point of contact. This
causes egg reaction - A small fertilization
cone / cone of reception is formed on the egg
membrane. The sperm head comes in contact
with this cone. It results in production of a weak
wave of depolarisation. Plasma membrane of
the both cells dissolve at the point of contact.
The sperm nucleus and the centrioles enter the
egg, while other parts remain outside.

process called syngamy or karyogamy. The
zygote is thus formed. The proximal centriole
recieved from the sperm helps in formation of
the synkaryon spindle and cleavage of cell into
two blastomeres.
Internet my friend
Find out about extraembryonic membranes.
Significance of fertilization :
• Secondary oocyte completes the process of
oogenesis and is transformed into a mature
ovum (n).

As soon as the sperm head touches the
vitelline membrane, a cortical reaction gets
activated changing the vitelline membrane
into a fertilization membrane by deactivating
the sperm receptors of zona pellucida. A
distinct perivitelline space is created around
the fertilization membrane. This prevents any
further entry of other sperms into the egg i.e.
polyspermy is avoided.

with the egg before it reaches the
fallopian tube?

pregnancy continue upto full term?

•

The diploid chromosome number is restored
in the zygote by the process of syngamy.

•

The ovum lacks the centrioles necessary
for further divisions, are received from the
sperm during fertilization.

•

Fertilization involves fusion of male and
female gametes from the two parents. It
results in variations which are significant
to evolution.

•

Sex of the offspring is determined.

Always Remember
•

c. Activation of ovum : The ovum before
fertilization was at metaphase II stage. With a
contact of sperm head to the vitelline membrane
of egg, it gets activated to resume and complete
its meiosis II. With this it gives out the second
polar body. The germinal vesicle organises into
female pronucleus. At this stage, it is the true
ovum or egg.

Fusion of egg and sperm : The coverings
of male and female pronuclei degenerate

Secondary oocyte (egg) is ovulated after
LH surge at about the middle of menstual
cycle i.e. day 14.
Egg (arrested at metaphase II) reaches
the ampulla of uterine tube in 12-24
hours after ovulation. The cilia and the
fimbriae of the fallopian tube help, direct
the egg to ostium.
During coitus/ intercourse semen is
deposited into the vagina of the female.
This process is called insemination.
Human male during ejaculation gives out
about 2-4ml of semen with an average
count of 200-400 million sperms.

is activated to divide.

arranged. Till the formation of morula the
zona pellucida is retained around the embryo
and thus, there is no change in the overall size
from zygote to morula. The morula reaches the
isthmus and gains entry into the uterus by the
end of day 4.

Cleavage :
It is the process of early mitotic division of
the zygote into a hollow multicellular blastula.
It does not involve the growth of the daughter
cells. The cells formed by cleavage are called
blastomeres.
Since, there is no growth phase between
the cleavages, the size of blastomeres will be
reduced with every successive cleavage. As
the size reduces, the metabolic rate increases.
Subsequent cleavages are thus faster than
earlier one. This requires rapid replication of
DNA and high consumption of oxygen.

Internet my friend
What is meroblastic cleavage? In which
organisms, is it observed?

Blastulation :
Blastulation is the process of formation
of the hollow and multicellular blastocyst.
The embryo (blastocyst) that enters the uterus
remains floating in uterine cavity for 2-4 days
after its entry. i.e. till the end of 7th day after
fertilization. The outer layer of cells seen in the
morula now form the layer called trophoblast.

The 1st cleavage in the zygote is meridional
and occurs at about 30 hours after fertilization. It
divides longitudinaly into two blastomeres, one
slightly larger than the other. The 2nd cleavage
is also longitudinal but at the right angle to
the 1st one and occurs after 30 hours of 1st
cleavage. The 3rd cleavage is horizontal. After
3rd cleavage the embryo is in 8-cell stage. As
the cleavages are going on the young embryo is
gradually being pushed towards the uterus. By
the end of 4th day after fertilization, embryo is a
solid ball of 16-32 cells and externally looking
like mulberry. This stage is thus called morula.
The morula shows cells of two types : smaller,
clearer cells towards the outer side and inner
cell mass of larger cells. Cells are compactly

Cells from the trophoblast begin to absorb
the glycogen rich uterine milk. The blastocyst
doubles in size from 0.15 mm to 0.30 mm. With
more fluid entering inside the blastocyst cavity
is formed. These outer cells become flat and are
called trophoblast cells (since they help only in
absorbing nutrition for the developing embryo).
The inner larger cells form inner cell mass or
embryoblast (the embryo proper develops
from the embryoblasts). These remain attached
33

to the trophoblasts on only one side. The
trophoblast cells in contact with the embryonal
knob are called cells of Rauber. At this stage,
the blastocyst shows polarity. The side with
inner cell mass is called the embryonal end and
the side opposite to it is the abembryonal end.
By the end of the 7th day the blastocyst is fully
formed. It is now ready for implantation and
gastrulation. The function of zona pellucida is
to prevent the implantation of the embryo at an
abnormal site. It does not expose the sticky and
phagocytic trophoblast cells till it reaches the
implantation site i.e. within the uterus, hence
zona pellucida now ruptures.

The inner layer of cells is called
cytotrophoblast (cells with defined membrane)
since, the cells retain their cell boundaries.
Gastrulation :
It is the process of formation of ‘gastrula’
from the blastocyst. In the gastrula stage, there
is slowing of the rate of cleavage or divisions
but there are two important events that take
place actively :
a. Differentiation of blastomeres : This process
results in the formation of three germinal layers
i.e. ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm from
the cells of the embryoblast.
b. Morphogenetic movements : These are
different types of movements to reach their
definite place in the embryo.

Can you recall?
What do you mean by Monozygotic
Dizygotic and Conjoined twins.

Ectoderm

Implantation :
The blastocyst after its formation, gets
implanted or embedded into the endometrium
of the uterus. This process usually begins
on day 7 after fertilization and by end of
10th day, the embryo is completely burried
inside the endometrium. The embryo usually
implants in the region of the fundus of uterus.
In the process, the embryo attaches itself by
its embryonic pole, close to the endometrium.
The trophoblast cells of the animal pole
have the power to stick to the uterine wall.
Rapid division of the trophoblast cells lying
against the embryonal knob takes place. It
results in the formation of two distinct layerssyncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast. The
outer layer, syncytiotrophoblast is syncytium
i.e. a layer of protoplasm with many nuclei. It
gives out processes which extensively invade
the endometrium. The lytic enzymes secreted
by the trophoblasts, rupture the endometrial
cells thereby making a burrow, into which
the embryo begins to get implanted. By the
end of the 10th day the whole embryo is deeply
embedded into the endometrium, completing
the process of implantation.

Gastrulation begins in the embryoblast
cells on about 8th day after fertilization. Cell on
the free end of inner cell mass called hypoblasts
(primitive endoderm) become flatend, start
dividing and grows downward towards the
blastocoel, cavity of blastocyst. This layer
called endoderm is first to differentiate. It grows
within the blastocoel and forms a sac called
Yolk sac. The remaining cell of the inner cell
mass, in contact with cells of Rauber are called
epiblasts (primary ectoderm). Both layers form
a flat, bilaminar embryonal disc.
After formation of endoderm the second
layer to be differentiated is the ectoderm. Cells
of epiblast divide and redivide and move in
such a way that they enclose the amiotic cavity.

and choroid of eye.
The floor of this cavity has the embryonal
disc. The pyramidal cells of the disc towards
the amniotic cavity form the embryonal
ectoderm. The roof of amniotic cavity is lined
by amniogenic cells. Later, these cells divide
and redivide to form the amnion. Amnion is
an extra embryonic membrane that surrounds
and protects the embryo. As a result of all
these changes, the bilaminar embryonic disc
is positioned in between amniotic cavity and
Yolk sac.

Do you know ?
Stem cells: These are undifferentiated somatic
cells of a multicellular organism. They are
capable of giving rise to many more cells of the
same type or they can also differentiate into other
type of cells. Bone marrow cells, blood stem cells
cord cells or umbilical cord cells are examples
of stem cells. They can be used in the treatment
of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
Diabetes, Leukemia, Arthritis, etc.

Actual gastrulation occurs about 15 days
after fertilization, in which the bilaminar
embryonic disc is transformed into trilaminar
embryonic disc. This transformation occurs by
division, rearrangement and migration of cells
of epiblast. It begins with formation of primitive
streak and a shallow groove on the surface is
called primitive groove. This streak progresses
from posterior to anterior end of embryo. From
site of a primitive streak, a third layer of cells
called mesoderm extends between ectoderm
and endoderm. Anterior end of primitive groove
communicates with yolk sac by an aperture
called blastopore (future anus). The embryonal
disc now has differentiated into three layersectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. The
further process after gastrulation is called
organogenesis.

2.7 Pregnancy :
It is the condition of carrying one or more
embryos in the uterus. It is also called gestation.
It refers to the period between fertilization
of the egg, upto parturition. The average
period of pregnancy in human lasts for 266
days from fertilization or 280 days (266+14)
counted from LMC- Last Mensturation Cycle.
This pregnancy peroid of approximately nine
months is divided into three trimesters of three
months each.
35

felt by the mother. Head has hair, eyebrows and
eyelashes appear, pinnae are distinct. The baby
reaches half the size of a newborn.

First Trimester :
(from fertilization to 12th week)
It is the time of most radical changes in
mother and embryo. The embryo receives
nutrients in the first 2-4 weeks directly from
the endomerium. It is the main period of
organogenesis and the development of body
organs. By the end of eight weeks, the major
structures found in the adult are formed in the
embryo in a rudimentary form. The embryo is
now called foetus. It is about 3cm long. Arms,
hands, fingers, feet, toes are formed. Foetus can
open and close mouth and fists. CNS is fully
formed, working of excretory and cirulatory
systems begins. Movements of foetus begin but
mother can not feel it. Heart beat can be heard
from 6th week. Progesterone level becomes high
and menstual cycle is suspended till the end of
pregnancy. At the end of first trimester foetus is
about 7-10 cm long.
Meanwhile, the mother’s body also
undergoes rapid changes. High levels
of progesterone initiate changes in her
reproductive system. The maternal part of
placenta grows, the uterus becomes larger. In
this period, the mother experiences ‘morning
sickness’ (nausea, vomiting, mood swings,
etc).

Third (final) Trimester :
(from 27th week till the parturition)
The foetus grows to about 3-4 kg in weight
and 50 cms in length. Eyes are open. There
is gain in body weight. As the foetus grows,
the uterus expands around it, the mother’s
abdominal organs become compressed and
displaced, leading to frequent urination,
digestive blackages and strain in the back
muscles. At the end of third trimester the
foetus becomes fully developed and ready for
parturition.
2.8 Placenta:
It is a flattened, discoidal organ in the
uterus of a pregnant woman. The placenta is a
temporary structural and functional connection
between foetal and maternal circulation.
The placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen
and nutrients and also for removal of carbon
dioxide and excretory wastes produced by the
foetus. The placenta is attached to the wall of
the uterus and to the baby’s umbilical cord.

Second Trimester :
(from 13th to 26th week)
It is the period of rapid growth of foetus.
The uterus grows enough for the pregnancy
to become abvious. The foetus is very active
and grows to about 30 cms. Development
of brain begins. Hormone levels stabilize as
hCG declines, the corpus luteum deteriorates
(regresses) and the placenta completely takes
over the production of progesterone which
maintains the pregnancy.
Ultrasound (sonography) at 18-20 weeks
shows baby’s growth and position. From
this estimated due date of delivery can be
established. Baby’s movements can be easily

part which is rich in blood supply shared by
the mother. It is a part of uterine wall, termed
as maternal placenta. So human placenta is
called haemochorial.
The umbilical cord is formed of three blood
vessels. Of these three blood vessels, two are
small arteries which carry blood towards the
placenta and one is a large vein which returns
blood to the foetus.
The placenta also acts as an endocrine
tissue and produces hormones like hCG,
progesterone, estrogen while relaxin is secreted
by the ovary in the later phase of pregnancy.
Level of hCG increases upto the end of first
trimester and then it declines. By the end of first
trimester progesterone is produced by placenta.
These hormones are required for foetal growth
and maintenance of pregnancy.

Always Remember
hCG, HPL (Human placental Lactogen),
relaxin are produced in women only during
pregnancy.
2.9 Parturition:
Humans are viviparous, as they give birth
to their young ones. Parturition is the process of
giving birth to a baby. The physical activities
involved in parturition like uterine and
abdominal contractions, dilation of cervix and
passage of baby are collectively called labour.
Labour is accompanied by localised sensation
of discomfort or agony called labour pains.
Parturition is controlled by a complex
neuroendocrine mechanism. Signals arise from
the fully formed foetus and placenta cause
mild uterine contractions. It is acompanied by
rise in estrogen- progesterone ratio, increase in
oxytocin receptors in uterine muscles, .
They cause vigorous contractions of
myometrium of uterus at the end of pregnancy.
The fully developed foetus gives signals
for the uterine contractions by secreting
Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) from
pituitary and corticosteroids from adrenal
gland. This triggers release of oxytocin from
mother’s pituitary gland, which acts on uterine
muscles of mother and causes vigourous uterine
contractions. This leads to expulsion of the
baby from the uterus. It involves the following
three steps :

and is accredited
by AABB (American Association of Blood
Bank). The cord blood bank functions
occording to the central and state government
policies, rules and guidelines.
Cord blood (umbilical cord blood) is the
blood that remains in the umbilical cord and
placenta, post delivery. Cord blood banking
is the process of collecting the cord blood,
extraction and cryogenically preserving for
its stem cells and other cells of the immune
system for future potential medical use. Cord
blood is rich in stem cells that can transform
into all sorts of blood cells. They can be
used to treat diseases that harm the blood
and immune system e.g. leukemia, certain
cancers, sickle cell anemia and some
metabolic disorders.

1. Dilation stage : Uterine contractions begin
from top, forcing the baby towards the cervix.
Contractions are accompanied by pain caused
by compression of blood vessels. Oxytocin
induced uterine contractions become stronger
and stronger due to stimulatory reflex. As the
baby is pushed down in the uterus, its head
comes to lie against cervix. Cervix gets dilated.
The vagina also shows similar dilation.
This stage of labour can normally last upto
few hours. It ends in rupturing of amniotic
membrane of foetus.

2. Expulsion stage : The uterine and abdominal
contractions become stronger. In normal
delivery, the foetus passes out through cervix
and vagina with head in forward direction. It
takes 20 to 60 min. The umbilical cord is tied
and cut off close to the baby’s navel.

Why is it said that consumption of
mother milk is safest for the new born?
2.11 Reproductive Health:
According to World Health Organisation
(WHO), reproductive health means total
wellbeing in all aspects of reproduction- its
emotional, behavioural and social aspects
along with the physical ones. Therefore, a
society with people having physically and
functionally normal reproductive organs and
normal emotional and behavioural interactions
amongst them in all sex-related aspects might
be called reproductively healthy society.

3. After birth : After the delivery of the baby
the placenta separates from the uterus and
is expelled out as “after birth”, due to severe
contractions of the uterus. This process happens
within 10 to 45 minutes of delivery.
2.10 Lactation:
The mammary glands of the female start
producing milk at the end of pregnancy by the
process of lactation. Prolactin is the hormone
which is responsible for production of milk.
Lactation helps the mother in feeding the new
born baby. The fluid secreted by the mammary
glands soon after child birth is called colostrum.
Colostrum: It is the sticky and yellow fluid
secreted by the mammary glands soon after
child birth. It contains proteins, lactose and
mother’s antibodies e.g. IgA. The fat content
in colostrum is low. The antibodies present in it
helps in developing resistance for the new born
baby at a time when its own immune response
is not fully developed.

Of all the social goals of India, an
important one is to attain total reproductive
health. India was amongst the first few
countries in the world to initiate action plans
and programmes at a national level to improve
reproductive health. All these improved
programmes cover wider areas related to
reproduction. These programs are currently in
operation under the Reproductive and Child
Health Care (RCH) programmes.
38

Goals of RCH Programmes:
1. To create awareness among people about
various aspects related to reproduction.
2. To provide the facilities to people to
understand and build up reproductive
health.
3. To provide support for building up a
reproductively healthy society.
4. To bring about a change mainly in three
critical health indicators i.e. reducing
total infertility rate, infant mortality rate
and maternal mortality rate.

7. By educating couples to reduce mortality
rate of new borns and maternal mortality
rate.
The population in India which was
approximately 350 millions at the time of
independence, reached close to a billion mark
by 2000 and crossed 1.2 billion in May 2011.
Now in 2020 population of India has crossed
1.35 billions. The government is taking serious
measures to check this population growth. The
most important step to overcome this problem,
is to motivate society to have smaller families
by using various birth control methods.

The goals of RCH can be achieved by the
following ways:
1. By introduction of sex education in
schools. Schools should be encouraged
to provide correct information to the
young so as to discourage children
from believing in myths and clear the
misconceptions about sex related aspects.
Proper information about safe and hygenic
sexual practices, sexually transmitted
diseases (STD, AIDS), problems related
to adolescence and proper information
about reproductive organs.
2. With the help of audio- visual and the print
media, government and non- government
organisations should take various steps to
create awareness about various aspects
related to reproduction.
3. By educating the younger generation
about birth control measures, pre-natal
care of pregnant woman and post-natal
care of the mother and child, importance
of breast feeding.
4. By developing awareness about problems
arising due to uncontrolled population
growth, social evils like sex abuse and
sex related crimes and take up necessary
steps to prevent them.
5. By creating awareness about statutory ban
on amniocentesis for sex determination.
6. By creating awareness about child
immunization programmes.

2.12 Birth control :
The birth control measures which
deliberately prevent fertilization are referred to
as contraceptives. The contraceptive methods
help to prevent unwanted pregnancies. An
ideal contraceptive should be easily available,
user friendly, effective and with no or least side
effects.
Contraceptive methods are of two main
types i.e. temporary and permanent.
a. Temporary methods:
These are of following types :
1. Natural method/ Safe period / Rhythm
method : In the natural method, the principle
of avoiding chances of fertilization is used.
A week before and a week after menstrual
bleeding is considered the safe period for sexual
intercourse. This idea is based on the fact that
ovulation occurs on the 14th day of menstrual
cycle. Its drawback lies in having a high rate
of failure.
2. Coitus Interruptus or withdrawal : In this
method, the male partner withdraws his penis
from the vagina just before ejaculation, so as to
avoid insemination. This method also has some
drawbacks, as the pre-ejaculation fluid may
contain sperms and this can cause fertilization.
3. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of
menstruation) : This method is based on the fact
that ovulation does not occur during the period
39

of intense lactation following parturition.
Therefore, as long as the mother breastfeeds the
child fully, chances of conception are almost
negligible. However, this method also has high
chances of failure.

Diaphragm

4. Chemical means (spermicides): In this
method, chemicals like foam, tablets, jellies,
and creams are used by the female partner.
Before sexual intercourse, if these chemicals
are introduced into the vagina, they adhere to
the mucous membrane, immobilize and kill the
sperms. It may cause allergic reaction. This
method also has chances of failure.
Lippes loop

5. Mechanical means / Barrier methods:
In this method, with the help of barriers the
ovum and sperm are prevented from physically
meeting. These mechanical barriers are of three
types.

Fig. 2.19 : Mechanical means

i) Condom: It is a thin rubber sheath that
is used to cover the penis of the male
during coputation. It prevents the entry
of ejaculated semen into the female
reproductive tract. This can prevent
conception. It is a simple and effective
method and has no side effects. “Nirodh”
is the most widely used contraceptive by
males. It is easily available and is given free
by the government. It should be properly
discarded after every use. Condom is also
a safeguard against STDs and AIDS.

ii) Diaphragm, cervical caps and vaults:
These devices used by the female are made
up of rubber. They prevent conception
by blocking the entry of sperms through
the cervix. The device is inserted into the
female reproductive tract to cover the
cervix during copulation.

Lippes loop is a plastic double “s” loop. It
attracts the macrophages stimulating them to
accumulate in the uterine cavity. Macrophages
increase phagocytosis of sperms within the
uterus and acts as a contraceptive. Copper
releasing IUDs suppress sperm motility and the
fertilising capacity of sperms.
The hormone releasing IUDs make the
uterus unsuitable for implantation and cervix
hostile to the sperms. It delays pregnancy for
longer period. The spontaneous expulsion,
occasional haemorrhage and chances of
infection are the drawbacks of IUDs.

iii) Intra-uterine devices (IUDs) : These
clinical devices are plastic or metal objects.
A doctor or trained nurse places the IUDs
into the uterus. These devices include
Lippes loop, copper releasing IUDs ( Cu-T,
Cu7, multiload 375) and hormone releasing
IUDs (LNG-20, progestasert).
40

b. Permanent Method:
The permanent birth control method in
men is called vasectomy and in women it is
called tubectomy.
These are surgical methods, also called
sterilization. In vasectomy a small part of
the vas deferens is tied and cut where as in
tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is
tied and cut. This blocks, gamete transport and
prevent pregnancy.

6. Physiological (Oral) Devices : Physiological
devices are used in the form of tablets and
hence are popularly called pills. It is an oral
contraceptive, used by the female. The pill
contains progesteron and estrogen. They inhibit
ovulation, hence no eggs are released from the
ovary of the female using this pill and thus
conception cannot occur. They also alter the
quality of cervical mucus to prevent the entry
of sperms.
The pills have side effects such as nausea,
weight gain, tenderness of breast and slight
blood loss between menstrual periods. The pill
“Saheli” is an oral contraceptive for females
which is nonsteroidal. Saheli is to be taken
once in a week. These pills are sponsored by
the Government.

7. Other contraceptives : The birth control
implant is a contraceptive used by the female. It
is a tiny, thin rod about the size of a matchstick.
It is implanted under the skin of the upper arm.
They contain progesterone and estrogen.
Their mode of action is similar to that of pills.
They prevent pregnancy for 3-4 years.

Fig. 2.22 : Permanent method
Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) :
An intentional or voluntary termination
of pregnancy before full term is called Medical
termination of Pregnancy (MTP) or induced
abortion. MTP is essential in cases of unwanted
pregnancies or in defective development of
foetus. It is safe during the first trimester of
pregnancy. The defective development of
foetus is examined by amniocentesis.

Fig. 2.21 : Implanon/ Nexplanon

41

Medical Termination of Pregnancy
(Amendment) Act 2017 under section 3 of the
MTP Act 1971 was enacted by Government
of India. The intention of MTP Act is to
reduce the incidence of illegal abortion and
consequent maternal mortality. As per the
provisions of the MTP Act, only the consent of
woman whose pregnancy is being terminated
is required. According to MTP Act pregnancy
may be terminated : 1. Within first 12 weeks
2. More than 12 weeks but lesser than 20
weeks. The registered medical practitioner’s
opinion is mandatory stating the continuation
of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the
life of the pregnant woman or grave abnormal
physical or mental health or is substantial risk
to the child.

Amniocentesis is a process in which
amniotic fluid containing foetal cells is collected
using a hollow needle inserted into the uterus
under ultrasound guidance. The chromosomes
are studied to see the abnormalities in the
developing foetus. But the dangerous trend
is the misuse of amniocentesis to determine
the sex of the unborn child. Frequently, if the
foetus is found to be female, it is aborted which
is totally illegal. So the Government of India
has legalised MTP Act in 1971, with strict
conditions to avoid its misuse.
Amniocentesis : Used to extract foetal cells for genetic analysis.
1. Ultrasound used to determine the
position of the foetus in the uterus
2. Needle inserted through the
abdominal and uterine wall

2.13 Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) :
Diseases or infections which are
transmitted through sexual intercourse are
collectively called Sexually Transmitted
Diseases (STDs) or Venereal Diseases (VDs) or
Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI). The major
venereal diseases are syphilis and gonorrhoea.

1. Miscarriage
2. Needle injury to foetus
3. Leaking amniotic fluid

IVF (In Vitro Fertization) :
It is a process of fertization where an
egg is combined with sperm outside the body
in a test tube or glass plate to form a zygote
under simulated conditions in the laboratory.
The zygote or early embryos (with up to 8
blastomeres) could be then transferred into the
fallopian tube for further development.

2.14 Infertility :
Infertility is defined as the inability
to conceive naturally after (one year of)
regular unprotected intercourse. The causes
of infertility could be physical, congenital,
diseases, immunological or even psychological.
The common physical causes in females are
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hormonal
imbalance, endometriosis while in male, it is
less sperm count and small size of penis.

ZIFT (Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer) :
ZIFT is an infertility treatment used
when there is a blockage in the fallopian tubes
which prevents the fertilization of egg by the
sperm.

Prior to 1978, infertile couple had two
options, adopt or be childless. Today infertile
couples have many options to have a child such
as fertility drugs, test tube babies, artificial
insemination, IUI, surrogate motherhood, etc.
The couple could be assisted to have child /
children through certain special techniques
commonly known as Assisted Reproductive
Technologies (ART).

In this method, egg is removed from
woman’s ovary. Fertilization of the egg with
sperms is brought about outside the body under
sterile conditions to form zygote by the process
called in vitro fertilization (IVF). The zygote
is then transferred to fallopian tube for further
development.
43

Sperm bank / Semen bank:
A sperm bank or semen bank is a place
which collects, stores and provides human
sperms / semen. The semen is provided by
healthy males called sperm donors. The sperms
are stored in sperm bank by cryopreservation
method (at low temperature).

IVF centres : Make a list of IVF centres
in Maharashtra.
GIFT (Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer) :
Transfer of an ovum collected from a
donor into the fallopian tube of another female
who can provide suitable environment for its
fertilization and development.
This technique called gamete intrafallopian
transfer (GIFT) has been developed for the
cases in which only the entrance to the oviducts
or the upper segment of the oviducts in blocked.
In this procedure ova and sperms are directly
injected into regions of the oviduct, where
fertilization produces a blastocyst, which
enters the uterus via the normal route. GIFT
has a success rate of about 30 percent.

Can you recall?
Surrogate mother :
Some women have problem in
implantation of embryo in uterus. Such
woman can take help of the modern remedial
technique called surrogacy. In this, embryo
is implanted in surrogate mother, who is not
the biological mother.
Adoption :
Adoption is a legal process by which
a couple or a single parent gets legal
rights, privileges and responsibilities that
are associated to a biological child for the
upbringing of the adopted child.
An adoptive parent should be medically fit
and financially able to take care of the adopted
child. A person wishing to adopt a child must
be at least 21 years old but there is no legal
upper age limit for adoption.

ICSI (Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection) :
ICSI is an in vitro fertilization procedure
in which a single sperm cell is injected directly
into cytoplasm of an ovum in the laboratory.
Here the sperm has to naturally penetrate the
egg.
Artificial Insemination (AI) :
In some infertility cases, the male partner
is unable to inseminate the female due to a very
low sperm count. This problem can be solved
by artificial insemination. In this technique,
the sperms are collected from the male and
artificially introduced into the cervix of female,
for the purpose of achieving a pregnancy
through in vivo fertilization (inside the body).

Always Remember
Tobacco, marijuana and other drugs
smoking may cause infertility in both men
and women. Nicotine blocks the production
of sperm and decreases the size of testicles.
Alcoholism by men interferes with the
synthesis of testosterone and has an impact
on sperm count. Use of cocaine or marijuana
may temporarily reduce the number and
quality of sperm.

IUI (Intra Uterine Insemination) :
In this technique the process is somewhat
like that of artificial insemination, the only
difference is that the sperms are introduced into
the uterine cavity instead of cervix.

Inheritance and Variation
Can you recall?

and offsprings?
2. What are the roles of chromosomes in
living organisms?
3. How are hybrid seeds produced?
4. Which are the chromosomal disorders?

•

3.1 Chromosomes and Mechanism of
inheritance.
• The transmission of genetic information
from generation to generation is known as
heredity or inheritance. The mechanism
of inheritance was successfuly investigated
before chromosomes had been observed or
genes were known.
• Gregor Mendel, son of the peasant farmer,
was born in Moravia in 1822. Gregor
Mendel first gave the accurate explanation
for the mechanism of inheritance by using
hybridization technique.
• Inheritance of the seven traits in garden
pea (Refer the diagram below) plant were
1.

studied individually one at a time or in
combination of two or three character at a
time. He processed the data mathematically
and statistically.
Mendel postulated the principles of heredity
which then became the fundamental laws
of heredity, as proposed by Correns (1900).
He visualized that the traits as such are
not inherited physically but by ‘something’
present inside the gametic cell. To this
‘something’, he coined term ‘factors’ that
are responsible for expression of a particular
trait/ character. He proposed that factors
are particulate in nature. The Mendelian
factors are now termed as ‘genes’. These
factors occur in pairs in the parents and
segregate from each other during gamete
formation without blending/ mixing.

Reasons for Mendel’s Success :
• His experiments were carefully planned
and involved large sample.
• He carefully recorded the number of plants
of each type and expressed his results as
ratios.

Phenotype : The external apperance of an
individual for any trait is called phenotype for
that trait. It is observable and is determined by
different combinations of alleles. e.g. In pea,
for the height of stem (plant) tall and dwarf are
the two phenotypes (Tall is determined by TT
or Tt and dwarf by tt).
Genotype : Genetic constitution or genetic
make up of an organism with respect to a
particular trait. It is representation of the genetic
constitution of an individual with respect to
a single character or a set of characters. e.g.
pea tall plants can have genotype TT or Tt and
dwarf has tt.
Homozygous (pure) : An individual possessing
identical allels for a particular trait, is called
homozygous or pure for that trait.
Homozygous breeds true to the trait and
produces only one type of gametes e.g., tall
with TT and dwarf with tt.
Heterozygous : An individual possessing
contrasting alleles for a particular trait, is
called heterozygous. Heterozygous does not
breed true for that trait and produces two types
of gametes e.g. F1 generation hybrids (Tt).
Heterozygous individual is also called hybrid.
Pure line : An individual or a group of
individuals (population) which is homozygous
or true breeding for one or more traits,
constitutes pure line i.e. plant which breeds true
for a particular character. It is a descendent of
a single homozygous parent produced after self
fertilization.
Monohybrid : It is heterozygous for one trait
and is produced from a cross between two pure
parents differing in single pair of contrasting
characters e.g. Hybrid tall produced in a cross
between pure tall and pure dwarf parents. It is a
heterozygote for a single pair of alleles.
F1 generation : It refers to the first filial
generation. It consists of all off-springs
produced from a parental cross. Alternatively, it
is first generation from a given mating between
pure parents having contrasting characters.

• In the pea plant, contrasting characters can
be easily recognized.
• The seven different charaters in pea
plant were controlled by a single factor
each. The factors are located on separate
chromosomes and these factors are
transmitted from generation to generation.
• He introduced the concepts of dominance
and recessiveness.
Before
learning
about
Mendel’s
experiments let us get acquainted with genetic
terms and symbols.
3.2 Genetic Terminology :
Character : It is a specific feature of an
organism e.g. height of stem.
Trait : An inherited character and its detectable
variant e.g. Tall or dwarf.
Factor : It is a unit of heredity, a particle
present in the organism which is responsible for
the inheritance and expression of a character.
(factor is passed from one generation to the
next through gametes). Factor determines a
genetical (biological) character of an organism.
Gene : It is a particular segment of DNA which
is responsible for the inheritance and expression
of that character.
Alleles or Allelomorphs : The two or more
alternative forms of a given gene (factor)
are called alleles of each other. They occupy
identical loci (positions) on homologous
chromosomes. Allele is a short form of
Allelomorph.
Dominant : It is an allele that expresses its trait
even in the presence of an alternative allele i.e.
in heterozygous condition only. Alternatively,
the allele that expresses in F1 is called
dominant. (It is an allele of a pair that masks
the expression of other allele in F1 generation.)
Recessive : This allele is not expressed
in the presence of an alternative allele (in
heterozygous condition). It expresses only in
the presence of another identical allele. It is an
allele that does not express in F1 hybrid.
50

F2 generation : The second generation
(progeny) produced by selfing (inbreeding) of
F1 generation offsprings is called second filial
generation. e.g. Progeny produced from a cross
between two F1 individuals (e.g. Tt × Tt).

Dihybrid cross :
A cross between parents differing in two
heritable traits, is called dihybrid cross e.g.
cross of pure tall, round seeded plant with
dwarf, wrinkled seeded plant. Mendel also
performed the dihybrid cross between pea
plants that differed in two pairs of contrasting
characters.

Test cross : It is a cross of F1 progeny with
homozygous recessive parent (e.g. F1 tall ×
pure dwarf i.e. Tt × tt). It is used to test the
homozygous/ heterozygous nature of hybrid. It
is a kind of back cross.
Phenotypic ratio : It is the ratio of the offsprings
produced in F2 and subsequent generation with

2. Law of segregation (Law of purity of
gametes) :
This law is based on the fact that the
alleles do not show any blending/ mixing and
both the alleles (characters) are recovered as
such in the F2 generation, though one of these
is not seen at the F1 stage. During formation of
gametes, these two alleles (factors) obviously
separate or segregate, otherwise recessive type
will not appear in F2.

The gametes which are formed are
always pure for a particular character (trait). A
gamete may carry either dominant or recessive
factor but not both. That’s why it is also called
as law of purity of gametes.

Use your brain power
There are 16 possible individuals in F2
generation. Try to find out the phenotypes as
well as the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.

Statement of Law of Segregation : The law
states that “When hybrid (F1) forms gametes,
the alleles segregate from each other and enter
in different gametes”. The gametes formed are
pure in that they carry only one allele each
(either dominant allele or recessive allele).
Hence, this law is also described as “Law of
purity of gametes”.

Can you tell?
Why are farmers and gardeners
advised to buy new F1 hybrid seeds every
year?
3.3 Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance :
Mendel proposed three basic postulates on
the basis of which three laws were formulated.
These are described below:

3. Law of Independent Assortment :
This law is based on dihybrid cross.
It is basic principle of genetics developed by
a Mendel. It describes how different genes
or alleles present on separate chromosomes
independently separate from each other, during
formation of gametes. These alleles are then
randomly united in fertilization. In dihybrid
cross, F2 phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1 indicates
that the two pairs of characters behave
independent of each other. It can be concluded
that the two characters under consideration are
assorted independently giving rise to different
combinations.

1. Law of Dominance :
In monohybrid and dihybrid crosses, the
phenotypic characters are controlled by discrete
units, called factors. In a dissimilar pair of
factors, one member of the pair dominates
(i.e. dominant) over the other (i.e. recessive).
The law of dominance is used to explain
the expression of only one of the parental
characters of a monohybrid cross in F1 and the
expression of both in F2.
Statement of Law of Dominance : “When
two homozygous individuals with one or more
sets of contrasting characters are crossed,
the alleles (characters) that appear in F1 are
dominant and those which do not appear in F1
are recessive”.

Statement of Law of Independent
Assortment: The law states that “When hybrid
possessing two (or more) pairs of contrasting
factors (alleles) forms gametes, the factors in
each pair segregate independently of the other
pair”.

Following is the graphic representation of
test cross (Fig. 3.1). Recessive parent is crossed
to find out unknown genotype.

3.4 Back Cross and Test Cross :
a. Back cross : The F1 individuals obtained in
a cross are usually selfed to get the F2 progeny.
They can also be crossed with one of the two
parents from which they were derived (either
recessive or dominant). Such a cross is known
as back cross.

3.5 Deviations from Mendel’s findings :
Few generalizations were arrived at by
Mendel, on the basis of his experiments of
garden pea plant- such as,
i. Single trait
Single gene
Two alleles.
ii. Two alleles show interaction in which one
is completely dominant.
iii. Factors (genes) for different traits
present on different chromosomes assort
independently.
With the passage of time, number of
deviations were observed/ identified in the
post-Mendelian era, that gave additional
information on the patterns of inheritance.
These deviations are then described as
Neo-Mendelism.

b. Test cross : The cross of F1 hybrid with the
homozygous recessive parent is known as a test
cross. It is used to test whether an individual is
homozygous (pure) or heterozygous(hybrid).
Test cross is easy, simple, repeatable and
predictable.
Test cross can be used to find out genotype
of any plant with dominant expression. But it is
not known whether it is homozygous (pure) or
heterozygous for that trait. For example, A pea
plant having violet (purple) flowers is crossed
with a pea plant with white flowers. If all
flowers produced are violet, we can conclude
that plant is pure or homozygous and if we get
violet and white flowers in 1:1 ratio, we can

It was observed that the phenotypic
expression of a gene can be modified or
influenced by the other gene. These gene
interactions are of two types.

b. Co-dominance :
In co-dominance, both the alleles (genes)
of an allelomorphic pair express themselves
equally in F1 hybrids. Such alleles which are able
to express themselves equally independently in
hybrids, are called co-dominant alleles. Thus
in co-dominance both alleles are expressed.

i. Intragenic interactions : Occur between
the alleles of same gene e.g. incomplete
dominance and co-dominance. It also
occurs between the multiple allele series of
a gene.
ii. Intergenic (non-allelic) interactions:
Occur between the allels of differentgenes present on the same or differentchromosomes. e.g. pleiotropy, polygenes,
epistasis, supplermetary and complementry
genes, etc. Some of these interactions are
discussed below :

a. Incomplete dominance:
In the incomplete dominance, both the
alleles (genes) of an allelomorphic pair express
themselves partially. One allele (gene) cannot
supress the expression of the other allele
(gene) completely. In such case, there is an
intermediate expression in the F1 hybrid. A
well-known example is the flower colour of
Mirabilis jalapa. If a red-flowered (RR) plant
is crossed with a white-flowered (rr) plant, then
F1 offsprings have pink (Rr) flowers.

Classic example of co-dominance is coat
colour in cattle. There are two types one with
red coat (with red colour hair) and other with
white coat (with white hair). When red cattles
(RR) are crossed with white cattles (WW), F1
hybrids (RW) are roan.
Roans have the mixture of red and white
colour hair. Thus both the traits are expressed
equally. In F2 generation red (RR), roans (RW)
and white (WW) are produced in the ratio
1:2:1. Thus in Co-dominance, the genotypic
and phenotypic ratios are identical.
c. Multiple alleles :
More than two alternative forms (alleles)
of a gene in a population accupying the same
locus on a chromosome or its homologue, are
known as multiple alleles. Multiple alleles arise
by mutations of the wild type of gene. A gene
can mutate several times producing a series of
alternative expression. Different alleles in a
series show dominant- recessive relation or may
show co-dominance or incomplete dominance
among themselves. Wild type is dominant over
all other mutant alleles.

Another good example of multiple alleles
is A, B, O blood grouping in human beings.
d. Pleiotropy :
When a single gene controls two (or more)
different traits, it is called pleiotropic gene
and the phenomenon is called pleiotropy
or pleiotropism. The phenotypic ratio is
1:2 instead of 3:1 because of the death of
recessive homozygote. The disease, sickle-cell
anaemia, is caused by a gene Hbs. Normal or
healthy gene HbA is dominant. The carriers
(heterozygotes HbA/Hbs) show signs of mild
anaemia as their RBCs become sickle-shaped
i.e. half- moon- shaped only under abnormally
low O2 concentration.

In Drosophila, a large number of multiple
alleles are known. e.g. The size of wings from
normal wings to vestigial (no) wings, i.e., just
stumps, is due to one allele (vg) in homozygous
condition. The normal wing is wild type while
vestigial wing is recessive type.

Walter Sutton along with Theodor Boveri
(1903) studied the parallel behaviour of
Mendel’s factors (genes) and behaviour of
chromosomes, at the time of meiosis.
Based on these observations, chromosomal
theory of inheritance was put forth by Sutton
and Boveri. This theory identifies chromosomes
as the carriers of genetic material.
This theory states that the chromosomes
are present in pairs in somatic cells. During
gamete formation homologous chromosomes
pair, segregate and assort independently during
meiosis. Thus, each gamete contains only one
chromosome from a pair.
Nucleus of gametes contains chromosomes,
which carry all hereditary traits. Male and
female gametes (sperms and eggs) carry all
the hereditary traits.They are the link between
parents and offsprings. The fusion of haploid
male gamete and haplaid female gamete,
restores the diploid number of chromosomes of
the species.

The homozygotes with recessive gene Hbs
however, die of total anaemia. Thus, the gene
for sickle- cell anaemia is lethal in homozygous
condition and produces sickle cell trait in
heterozygous carrier. Two different expressions
are produced by a single gene.
A marriage between two carriers will
produce normal, carriers and sickle-cell
anaemic children in 1:2:1 ratio. Sickle cell
anaemics die leaving carriers and normals in
the ratio 1:2. The heterozygotes or carriers can
be identified by microscopic examination of
blood.

3.6 Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance :
Gregor Johann Mendel published his work
on inheritance of traits in 1866 but for some
reasons, it remained unnoticed or unrecognised
till 1900, as communication was not easy in those
days. His work was not widely recognized. His
approach of using mathematics and statistics
to explain biological phenomenon was totally
new and unacceptable to the then biologists.
As continuous variations were observed in
nature, Mendel’s concept of factors (genes) as
stable and discrete unit which controlled the
expression of characters, and that a pair of
alleles did not “blend” with each other, was not
accepted by his contemporaries. He also did
not know the physical location of the ‘factors’
(genes) in the gametic cell.
In 1900, three scientists Hugo de Vries,
Correns and von Tschermak, independently
rediscovered Mendel’s work on the inheritance
of traits. Due to advancements in microcopy,
scientists were able to observe cell division
and the structure of chromosomes under
microscope.

Function :
Chromosomes are carriers of heredity.
Number of chromosomes :
The number of chromosomes is specific and
constant for a particular species, therefore it is
of great importance in the study of phylogeny
and taxonomy of the species.
The term Ploidy speaks for the degree
of repetition of the primary basic number of
chromosomes (i.e. ‘x’) in a cell. When the
chromosome number in a cell is the exact
multiple of the primary basic number, then it is
called euploidy. Euploids include monoploid/
haploid (with one set of chromosomes where
x=n), diploids (2n-two sets of chromosomes),
triploids (3n-three sets of chromosomes),
tetraploid (4n-four sets of chromosomes) and
so on. When the chromosome number is not the
exact multiple of the haploid set, it is described
as Aneuploidy. Aneuploidy is either addition
or deletion of one or more chromosome (s) to
the total number of chromosomes in a cell (see
the chart 3.5).

Always Remember
1. Genes and chromosomes occur always in
pairs in diploid organism.
2. Alleles located on chromosome segregate
along with chromosome during gamete
formation.
Can you recall?
1. What is chromosome?
2. How many chromosomes are present in
human somatic and reproductive cell?
3.7 Chromosomes :
Chromosomes are filamentous bodies
present in the eukaryotic nucleus. The term
chromosomes (Gr., Chromo = colour, soma
= body) was coined by W. Waldeyer (1888).
The size of chromosome varies from species to
species. Each metaphase chromosome varies
from 0.1 to 33 mm in length and 0.2 to 2 mm in
thickness. Chromosomes are visible during cell
division. They are capable of self replication
and play vital role in heredity, mutation,
variation, and evolutionary devlopment of
eukaryotic species. Chemically eukaryotic
chromosomes are made of DNA, histone and
non-histone proteins.

Structure of chromosome :
Chromosomes are best visible under
microscope, when the cell is at metaphase
stage. It is because at this stage chromosomes
are highly condensed. Typical chromosome

Depending upon the position of centromere
there are four types (shapes) of chromosomes
viz. Acrocentric (j shaped), Telocentric
(i shaped), Submetacentric (L shaped)
and Metacentric (V shaped). The ends of
chromosome (i.e. chromatids) are known as
telomeres.
Sex Chromosomes :
The chromosomes which are responsible
for the determination of sex are known as sex
chromosomes (Allosomes). Human being and
other mammals have X and Y Chromosomes
as sex chromosomes.
X chromosome is straight, rod like and
longer than Y chromosome. X chromosome
is metacentric, while Y chromosome is
acrocentric. X chromosome has large amount
of euchromatin (extended region) and small
amount of heterochromatin (highly condensed
region). Euchromatin has large amount of
DNA material, hence genetically active. Y
chromosome has small amount of euchromatin
and large amount of heterochromatin, hence it
is genetically less active or inert. Both X and
Y chromosome show homologous and nonhomologous regions. Homologous regions
show similar genes while non-homologous
regions show dissimilar genes.

consists of two chromatides joind together at
centromere or primary constriction. Primary
constriction constists of a disk shape plate called
kinetochore. It is at the kinetochore, spindle
fibres get attached during cell division. Besides
primary constriction, some few chromosomes
possess additional one or two constrictions
called secondary constriction. At secondary
constriction I, nucleolus becomes organized
during interphase. A satellite body (SAT body)
is attached at secondary constriction II, in very
few chromosomes. Each chromatid in turn
contains a long, unbranched, slender, highly
coiled DNA thread, called Chromonema,
extending through the length of chromatid.
Chromatid consists a double stranded
DNA molecule which extends from one end of
chromosomes to other.

The number of linkage groups of a particular
species corresponds to its haploid number of
chromosomes. e.g. Drosophila melanogaster
has 4 linkage groups that corrrspond to the
4 pairs of chromosomes. Garden pea has 7
linkage groups and 7 pairs of chromosomes.
Sex-linkage :
The transmission (inheritance) of X - linked
and Y-linked genes from parents to offspring,
is called sex-linked inheritance. Sex-linked
inheritance is of three types viz. X-linked,
Y-linked and XY-linked. Sex linkage is of two
kinds :
a. Complete sex linkage : It is exhibited by
genes located on non-homologous regions of
X and Y chromosomes. They inherit together
because crossing over does not occur in this
region.
Examples of
X-linked traits are
haemophilia, red-green colour blindness,
myopia (near sightedness) and for Y-linked are
hypertrichosis, Ichthyosis, etc.

are persent on non-homologous region of
Y-chromosome.

1. What are allosomes?
2. Compare X and Y chromosomes.
3. In which region of chromosomes does
crossing over take place?
3.8 Linkage and Crossing Over :
Linkage :
It is a known fact that several genes are
present on the chromosome. As chromosomes
are carriers of heredity, these genes have
tendency to be inherited together. Such genes
are called linked genes. This tendency of two or
more genes present on the same chromosomes
that are inherited together is known as linkage.
Linkage was discovered in plants by Bateson
and Punnett and in animals by T. H. Morgan.
Linkage is of two kinds - complete and
incomplete linkage:
I. Complete linkage : The linked genes which
are closely located on the chromosome do not
separate (no crossing over) and inherit together.
They are called completely linked (strongly
linked) genes and the phenomenon of their
inheritance is called complete linkage. Thus
the parental traits are inherited in offsprings.
e.g. X chromosome of Drosophila males- show
complete linkage.
II. Incomplete linkage : The linked genes
which are distantly located on the same
chromosome and have chances of separation
by crossing over, are known as incompletly
linked (weakly linked) genes. The phenomenon
of their inheritance, is called incomplete
linkage. Thus, new traits occur in offsprings.
e.g. In Zea mays - colour and shape of grain
show incomplete linkage.
Linkage Groups :
All the linked genes in a particular
chromosome, constitute a linkage group.

b. Incomplate sex linkage : It is exhibited by
genes located on homologous regions of X and
Y chromosomes. They do not inherit together
because crossing over occurs in this region.
Examples of X-Y linked traits are total colour
blindess, nephritis, retinitis pigmentosa, etc.
Crossing Over :
Crossing over is a process that produces
new combinations (recombinations) of genes by
interchanging and exhanging of corresponding
segments between non-sister chromatids of
homologous chromosomes. It occurs during
pachytene of prophase I of meiosis. The
term crossing over was coined by Morgan.
The mechanism of crossing over consists
four sequential steps such as synapsis, tetrad
formation, crossing over and terminalization.
This you have already studied in the chapter
on cell division in class XI. The phenomenon
of crossing over is universal and it is necessary
for the natural selection, because it increases
the chances of variation.

• Morgan’s Experiments showing linkage
and crossing over :

Know the Scientist :

Morgan used Drosophila melanogaster
(fruit fly) for his experiments because,
Drosophila can easily be cultured in laboratory.
It’s life span is short, about two weeks. More
over, it has high rate of reproduction.
Morgan carried out several dihybrid cross
experiments in fruit fly to study genes that are
sex-linked. The crosses were similar to dihybrid
crosses, as carried out by Mendel in Pea.
For example, Morgan and his group crossed
yellow-bodied, white eyed female to the wild
type with brown-bodied, red eyed males and
intercrossed their F1 progeny.

Thomas Hunt Morgan
was an American biologist.
He used fruit fly (Drosophila
melanogaster) in genetic
reserch and established the
chromosomal
theory
of
T. H. Margan heredity. He also discovered
the principle of linkage, sex
(1866-1945)
linkage and crossing over.
Margan’s work played key role in the
field of genetics. He was awarded a Nobel
Prize in 1933, in Physiology and Medicine.

He observed that the two genes did not
segregate independently of each other and F2
ratio deviated very signiticantly from 9:3:3:1
ratio.
Morgan and his group knew that the genes
were located on X chromosome and stated that
when two genes in a dihybrid cross are situated
on the same chromosome, then the proportion
of parental combination is much higher than
non-parental type. This occurs due to physical
association or linkage of the two genes. He also
found that, when genes are grouped on the same
chromosome, some genes are strongly linked.
They show very few recombinations (1.3 %).
When genes are loosely linked i.e. present far
away from each other on chromosome, they
show more (higher) recombinations (37.2 %).
For example, the genes for yellow body
and white eye were strongly linked and showed
only 1.3 percent recombination (in cross-I).
White bodied and miniature wings showed
37.2 percent recombination (in cross-II).
Cross I shows crossing over between genes y
and w. Cross II shows crossing over between
genes white (w) and miniature wing (m). Here
dominant wild type alleles are represented with
(+) sign.

Some characters are influenced by
dominant genes while some other are by
recessive genes, present on autosomes. For
example,
• Autosomal dominant traits like Widow’s
peak and Huntington’s disease, etc.
• Autosomal recessive traits like Phenyl
ketonuria (PKU), Cystic fibrosis and Sickle
cell anaemia.
a. Widow’s peak :
A prominent “V” shaped hairline on
forehead is described as widow’s peak. It is
determined by autosomal dominant gene.
Widow’s peak occurs in homozygous dominant
(WW) and also heterozygous (Ww) individuals.
Individuals with homozygous recessive
(ww) genotype have a straight hair line (no
widows peak). Both males and females have
equal chance of inheritance.

Always Remember
Parental combinations occur more
due to linkage and new combinations less due
to crossing over.

b. Phenylketonuria (PKU):It is an inborn metabolic disorder caused
due to recessive autosomal genes. When
recessive genes are present in homozygous
condition, phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme
is not produced. This enzyme is essential
for conversion of amino acid phenylalanine
into tyrosine. Due to absence of this enzyme,
phenylalanine is not converted into tyrosine.
Hence, phenylalanine and its derivatives
are accumulated in blood and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF). It affects development of brain
and causes mental retardation. Excess
phenylalanine is excreted in urine, hence this
disease is called phenylketonuria.

3.9 Autosomal Inheritance :
Human somatic (2n) cell contains
23 pairs of chromosomes. They can be
divided functionally as autosomes and sex
chromosomes. A single pair of chromosomes is
involved in sex determination and remaining 22
pairs are called autosomes. Autosomes control
a variety of traits other than sex. These traits
are called autosome linked traits. Transmission
of body characters other than the sex linked
traits from parents to their offsprings through
autosomes, is called autosomal inheritance.
61

Autosomal recessive traits appear in both
sexes with equal frequency. These traits tend to
skip generations.

as hypertrichosis is responsible for excessive
development of hair on pinna of ear. This
charater is transmitted directly from father to
son.

3.10 Sex Linked Inheritance :
Genes located on non-homologous region
of sex chromosomes, are called sex-linked
genes. The traits that are determined by sex
linked genes, are called sex-linked traits.
The inheritance of sex linked genes from
parents to their offsprings, is called sex linked
inheritance. There are two types of sex-linked
genes as X-linked genes and Y-linked genes.

Internet my friend
Collect information of Ishihara’s Test for
colour blindess.
Colour blindness :
Colour blindness is X-linked recessive
disorder where person is unable to distinguish
between red and green colours as both the
colours appear grey. It is caused due to recessive
X-linked genes (XC) which prevents formation
of colour sensitive cells, the cones, in the retina
of eye.

a. X-linked (sex linked) genes :
The X linked genes are located on non
homologous region of X chromosome and
these gene do not have corresponding alleles
on Y chromosome.
Female has two X chromosomes. In female
two recessive sex linked genes are required
for expression of sex linked traits. If one X
chromosome carries a recessive gene for sexlinked trait (defect) its effect is suppressed
by the dominant gene present on other X
chromosome. The females with one recessive
gene are carriers. The carrier female is
physically normal as she does not suffer from
the disease (disorder).
Male has only one X-chromosome. If
X chromosome carries X-linked recessive
gene for sex linked trait, then it is expressed
phenotypically, because there is no dominant
gene on Y chromosome to suppress its
effect. Therefore, sex-linked / X-linked traits
appear more frequently in males than in the
females. Examples of X-linked traits include
haemophilia, colour blindness, night blindness,
myopia, muscular dystrophy, etc.

The homozygous recessive females (Xc
Xc) and hemizygous recessive male (XcY) are
unable to distinguish between red and green
colours. The frequency of colour blind women
is much less than colour blind men. Dominant
X linked gene (XC) is necessary for formation of
colour sensitive cells in the retina of eye. Thus,
genotypes of male and female individuals can
be represented as followsSex

Normal

Colourblind

XcY

Female XCXC

The inheritance of colourblindness can
be studied in the following two types of
marriages:1. Marriage between colour blind male with
normal female, will produce normal visioned
male and female offspring in F1. The sons have
normal vision but daughter will be carrier for
the disease.

b. Y-linked (Holandric) genes :
Genes located on non-homologous region
of Y chromosome, are called Y linked genes.
The Y-linked genes are inherited directly from
male to male. In man, the Y-linked genes such

are dominant over the recessive genes for

The recessive gene for haemophilia is

German biologist, Henking in 1891,
while studying spermatogenesis of the squash
bug (Anasa tristis), noted that 50% of sperms
receive the unpaired chromosomes while other
50% sperm do not receive it. Henking gave
a name to this structure as the x-body but he
could not explain its role in sex determination.
Further investigations by other scientists led
to conclusion that the “x-body” of Henking
was infact a chromosome and gave the name
‘X-Chromosome’.

a. Sex Determination in human beings :
The chromosomal mechanism of sex
determination in human beings is XX-XY type.
In human beings, the nucleus of each somatic
cell contains 46 chromosomes or 23 pairs
of chromosomes. Out of these, 22 pairs are
autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.

Do you know ?
Haemophilia is also referred as “The
royal disease”, because it affected the royal
families of England, Germany, Russia and
Spain in the 19th and 20th centuries. Queen
Victoria of England, who ruled from 18371901, was belived to have been the carrier of
haemophilia. She passed the trait on to her
three of nine children.

Human female has a pair of XX,
homomorphic sex chromosomes while male
has XY, heteromorphic sex chromosomes.
Thus genotype of :
Female = 44 Autosomes + XX
Male = 44 Autosomes + XY

Find out

During gamete formation in male,
the diploid germ cells in testis undergo
spermatogenesis to produce two types of haplaid
sperms, 50% sperms contain 22 autosomes and
X chromosome while, 50% sperms contain 22
autosomes and Y chromosome.

Aarya shows normal blood clotting
but her mother is haemophilic. Ramesh
shows normal blood clotting but his father is
haemophilic. If Ramesh and Aarya were to
marry, then find out the posible phenotypes of
their offsprings.

In Female, the diploid germ cells in
ovaries undergo oogenesis to produce only one
type of egg. All eggs contain 22 autosomes
and X chromosome. Thus human male is
heterogametic and female is homogametic.

3.11 Sex Determination :
The mechanism by which sex is established
is termed as sex determination. The term sex
refers to sexual phenotype. In some species,
both male and female reproductive organs are
present in same organism. It is discribed as
bisexual or hermaphrodite or monoecious.

If sperm containing X chromosome
fertilizes egg (ovum), then diploid zygote is
formed, that grows into a female child. If

In Bonellia viridis, the environmental
factors determine the sex of individual.
The sex of worm Bonellia viridis depends on
which location the Bonellia larva gets settled.
The marine female Bonellia worm has
about 10 cm long body. She has a proboscis
that can extend over a meter in length. If
a Bonellia larva settles on the seafloor, it
becomes a female.
However when, a larva lands on a
female’s proboscis and enters the female’s
mouth, it migrates into her uterus and
differentiates into a male. Male lives as
parasite in uterus of female fertilizing her
eggs.

Conclusion : 1:1 sex ratio is produced

Fig. 3.14 : Sex determination in

sperm containing Y chromosome fertilizes the
egg, then diploid zygote is formed that grows
into a male child.
This indicates that the sex of a child
depends on the type of sperm fertilizing the
egg and hence the father is responsible for
determination of sex of child and not the
mother. Due to lack of knowledge, women are
often blamed for giving birth to female child.
b. Sex Determination in birds :
In birds, the chromosomal mechanism of
sex determination is ZW-ZZ type. In this type
females are heterogametic and produce two
types of eggs; 50% eggs carry Z- chromosome,
while 50% eggs carry W- chromosome.
Males are homogametic and produce
one type of sperms. Each sperm carries a Zchromosome. Thus sex of individual depends
on the kind of egg (ova) fertilized by the sperm.

c. Sex Determination in honey bees :
In honey bees, chromosomal mechanism
of sex determination is haplo-diploid type. In
this type, sex of individual is determined by
the number of set of chromosomes received.
Females are diploid (2n=32) and males are
haploid (n=16). The female produces haploid
eggs (n=16) by meiosis and male produces
haplaid sperms (n=16) by mitosis. If the egg
is fertilized by sperm, the zygote develops into

Depending upon which chain of
haemoglobin is affected, thalassemia is
classified as alpha-thalassemia and betathalassemia. It is caused due to deletion or
mutation of gene which codes for alpha (a) and
beta (b) globin chains that result in abnormal
synthesis of haemoglobin. In Thalassemia,
person shows symptoms like anaemia, pale
yellow skin, change in size and shape of RBCs,
slow growth and development, dark urine, etc.
Massive blood transfusion is needed to these
patients. Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell
anaemia. The former is a qualitative problem
of synthesising few globin molecule, while the
latter is a qualitative problem of synthesising
an incorrectly functional globin.
Down’s Syndrome (21st trisomy) :
Down’s syndrome is named after the
physician John Langdon Down who first
described this autosomal chromosomal disorder
in 1866.

a diploid female (2n=32) (queen and worker)
and unfertilised egg develops into haploid male
(n=16) (Drone) by way of parthenogenesis.
The diploid female gets differentiated
into either worker or queen depending on the
food they consume during their development.
Diploid larvae which get royal jelly as food
develops into queen (fertile female) and other
develops into workers (sterile females).

3.12 Genetic Disorders :
Genetic Disorders are broadly grouped
into two categories as, Mendelian disorders
and chromosomal disorders, Mendelian
discorders are mainly caused due to alteration
or mutation in the gene. e.g. thalassemia, sicklecell anaemia, colourblindness, haemophilia,
phenylketonuria, etc. On the other hand,
chromosomal disorders are caused due to
absence or excess of one or more chromosomes
or their abnormal arrangment. For eg, Down’s
syndrome, Turner’s syndrome, Klinefelter’s
syndrome etc.
Thalassemia :
Thalassemia is an autosomal, inherited
recessive disease. Haemoglobin molecule is
made of four polypeptide chains- 2 alpha (a)
and 2 beta (b) chains. The synthesis of alpha
chains are controlled by two closely linked
genes (HBA1 and HBA2) on chromosome
16 while the synthesis of beta chain is controlled
by a single gene (HBB) on chromosome 11.

Fig. 3.17 : Down’s Syndrome
This Syndrome is caused due to an extra
copy of chromosome number 21st. It shows
presence of three copies of 21st chromosome
instead of homologous pair. These individuals
will have 47 chromosomes instead of the
normal number 46. 21st Trisomy occurs due
to non-disjuction or failure of separation of
chromosomes (autosomes) during gamete
formation. The incidence of non-disjunction
is distinctly higher in mothers who are over 45
years old.
66

Turner’s Syndrome :
(X monosomy / XO females)
It is sex chromosomal disorder caused
due to non-disjunction of chromosome during
gamete formation. Individual born with
Turner’s syndrome has 44 autosomes with XO.
They are phenotypically female. They have a
short stature (height) and webbed neck, lower
posterior hair line, broad shield-shaped chest,
poorly developed ovaries and breast, and low
intelligence.

These patients have mild or moderate
mental retardation and skeletal development
is poor. Distinct facial features like small
head, ears and mouth, face is typically flat
and rounded with flat nose, open mouth and
protruding tongue, eyes slant up and out with
internal epicanthal folds, flat hands and stubby
fingers and palm is broad with single palmer
crease.

Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY males) :
It is chromosomal disorder caused due to
extra X chromosome in males. Thus genotype
of individuals is 44 + XXY. They are described
as feminized males. Extra chromosome is a
result of non-disjunction of X-chromosome
during meiosis. Individual is male and has
over all masculine development. Voice pitch
is harsh and have under developed testis. They
are tall with long arms, feminine development
(development of breast i.e. Gynaecomastia)
and no spermatogenesis, therefore, individuals
are sterile.

Molecular Basis of Inheritance
On the other hand DNA thought to be
small, simple molecule whose composition
varied little among species. Over the time,
these ideas about DNA were shown to be
wrong. In fact DNA molecules are large and
vary tremendously within and among species.
Variations in the DNA molecules are different
than the variation in shape, electrical charge
and function shown by proteins so it is not
surprising that most researchers initially
favored proteins as the genetic material.
Over a period of roughly 25 years (19281952), geneticists became convinced that DNA
and not protein, was the genetic material. Let
us study three important contributions that
helped cause this shift of opinion.

Can you recall?
1.
2.
3.
4.

What is nucleic acid?
What are the types of nucleic acid?
What are the functions of nucleic acid?
What is the difference between DNA in
prokaryotes and eukaryotes?

4.1 The Discovery of DNA:
Modern understanding of DNA has evolved
from the discovery of nucleic acid to the
development of the double-helix model. In 1869,
Friedrich Miescher began working with white
blood cells which are the major component of
pus from infections. He collected a lot of pus
from bandages at the local hospital. He used a
salt solution to wash the pus off the bandages.
When he added a weak alkaline solution to the
cells, the cells lysed and nuclei precipitated
out of the solution. From the cell nuclei, he
isolated a unique chemical substance to
which he called nuclein. Chemically, nuclein
has high phosphorus content. Moreover it
showed acidic properties. Hence it was named
as nucleic acid.
By the early 1900s, we knew that
Miescher's nuclein was a mix (mixture) of
proteins and nucleic acids. There are two kinds
of nucleic acids. DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).

Griffith’s experiments :
In 1928, a British medical officer Frederick
Griffith performed an experiment on bacterium
Streptococcus pneumoniae that causes
pneumonia in humans and other mammals.
Griffith used two strains or two genetic varieties
of Streptococcus to find a cure for pneumonia,
which was a common cause of death at that
time. The two strains used were :
i. Virulent,
smooth,
pathogenic
and
encapsulated S type.
ii. Non-virulent, rough, non-pathogenic and
non-capsulated R type.

4.2 The Genetic Material is a DNA:
By the early 1900s, geneticist knew that
genes control the inheritance of traits, that
genes are located on chromosome and that
chemically chromosomes are mainly composed
of DNA and proteins. Initially, most geneticists
thought that protein are large, complex
molecules and store information needed to
govern cell metabolism. Hence it was assumed
that proteins caused the variations observed
within species.

Griffith conducted four experiments on
these bacteria. First, when he injected bacteria
of strain R to mice, the mice survived because
it did not develop pneumonia. Second, when he
injected bacteria of strain S to mice, the mice
developed pneumonia and died. In the third
experiment, he injected heat-killed strain S
bacteria to mice, once again the mice survived.
In fourth experiment, he mixed heat-killed
S bacteria with live bacteria of strain R and
injected to mice. The mice died and Griffith
70

They also discovered that protein –digesting
enzymes (proteases), RNA-digesting enzyme
(RNAases) did not affect transformation, so the
transforming substance was neither a protein
nor RNA. DNA digested with DNAse did
inhibit the transformation, suggesting that DNA
caused the transformation. These experiments
proved that the transforming principle is DNA
but all biologists were not convinced.

recovered large numbers of live strain S
bacteria from the blood of the dead mice.
In these four experiments, something had
caused harmless strain R bacterium to change
into deadly S strain bacterium. Griffith showed
that the change was genetic. He suggested
that genetic material from heat-killed strain
S bacterium had somehow changed the living
strain R bacterium into strain S bacterium.
Griffith concluded that the R-strain
bacterium must have taken up, to what he
called a "transforming principle" from the heatkilled S bacterium, which allowed R strain to
get transformed into smooth-coated bacterium
and become virulent.

Hershey - Chase Experiment:
Hershey and Chase worked with viruses
that infect bacteria i.e. bacteriophages, which
are composed of DNA and protein. They used
radioactive phosphorous 32P in the medium for
some viruses and radioactive sulphur 35S for
some others.
They grew some viruses on a medium that
contained radioactive phosphorus and some
others on medium that contained radioactive
sulphur. Viruses grown in the presence of
radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive
DNA (labelled DNA), but not radioactive
proteins because DNA contains phosphorus
(labelled DNA) but proteins do not. Similarly,
viruses grown on radioactive sulphur contained
radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA
because DNA does not contain sulphur.
Radioactive phages were allowed to
infect E.coli bacteria grown on the medium
containing normal ‘P’ and ‘S’. Then, as

Avery, McCarty and MacLeod’s experiment:
In 1944, after some 10 years of research
and experimentation, U. S. microbiologists
Oswald T. Avery, Colin M. MacLeod and
Maclyn McCarty (all at Rockefeller University
in New York) first evidenced to prove the DNA
is a genetic material (transforming principle),
through the experiments. They purified DNA,
RNA, Proteins (enzymes) and other materials
from cell free extract of S cells/ strain and mixed
with heat killed S strain and R cells seperately
to confirm which one could transform living
R cells into S cells. Only DNA was able
to transform harmless strain R into deadly
strain S.

the infection proceeded, the viral coats
were removed with the help of centrifuge.
Bacteria which were infected by viruses with
radioactive DNA, were radioactive, indicating
that DNA was the material that passed from
the viruses to the bacteria. Bacteria which were
infected by viruses having radioactive sulphur
(protein) were not radioactive. This indicates
that proteins from the viruses, did not enter
the bacteria. DNA is, therefore, the genetic
material that is passed from virus to bacteria
(fig. 4.3).

Can you recall?
1. What are the chemical components of
DNA?
2. What is a chromosome?
4.3 DNA packaging :
Length of DNA double helix molecule, in
a typical mammalian cell is approximately
2.2 meters. (This can be worked out simply by
multiplying the total number of base pairs with
distance between the consecutive base pairs).
Approximate size of a typical nucleus is 10-6
m. How this long DNA molecule can be then
accommodated in such a small nucleus? It,
therefore, must be condensed, coiled and super
coiled to fit inside such small nucleus.

In other words, sometime after infection,
radioactivity for ‘P’ and ‘S’ was tested. Only
radioactive ‘P’ was found inside the bacterial
cell, indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Bacteriophage
Sulfur labeled

Packaging in Prokaryotes:
In prokaryotes like E. coli, cell size is almost
2-3m long. They do not have well organized
nucleus. It is without nuclear membrane and
nucleolus. The nucleoid is small, circular,
highly folded, naked ring of DNA which is
1100m long in perimeter, containing about 4.6
million base pairs.

2. Blending

The 1100m long (approximately 1.1 mm, if
cut and stretched out) nucleoid is to be fitted
or packaged into a cell which is hardly 2-3m
long. Hence the negatively charged DNA
becomes circular, reducing the size to 350mm
in diameter. This is further reduced to 30mm
in diameter because of folding/ looping. 40-50
domains (loops) are formed. Formation of loops
is assisted by RNA connectors. Each domain is
further coiled and supercoiled, thereby reducing
the size down to 2m in diameter. This coiling
(packaging) is assisted by positively charged
HU (Histone like DNA binding proteins)
proteins and enzymes like DNA gyrase and
DNA topoisomerase I, for maintaining super
coiled state.

Fig. 4.4 : DNA Packaging in Prokaryotes
Packaging in Eukaryotes:
Eukaryotes show well organized nucleus
containing nuclear membrane, nucleolus
and thread-like material in the form of
chromosomes. In the chromosomes, DNA is
associated with histone and non-histone proteins
as was reported by R. Kornberg in 1974. The
organization of DNA is much more complex in
eukaryotes. Depending upon the abundance of
amino acid residues with charged side chains,
a protein acquires its charge. Histones are the
proteins that are rich in lysine and arginine
residues. Both these amino acid residues are
basic amino acids and carry positive charges
with them. So, histones are a set of positively
charged, basic proteins (histones + protamine).
These histones organize themselves to make a
unit of 8 molecules known as histone octamer.
H2A

H2B

The negatively charged helical DNA
is wrapped around the positively charged
histone octamer, forming a structure known
as nucleosome. The nucleosome core is made
up of two molecules of each of four types of
histone proteins viz. H2A, H2B, H3and H4. H1
protein binds the DNA thread where it enters
(arrives) and leaves the nucleosome.
One nucleosome approximately contains
200 base pair long DNA helix wound around
it (fig. 4.5). About 146 base pair long segment
of DNA remains present in each nucleosome.
Nucleosomes are the repeating units of
chromatin, which are thread-like, stained
(coloured) bodies present in nucleus. These look
like ‘beads-on-string’, when observed under
an electron microscope. DNA helix of 200 bps
wraps around the histone octamer by 1¾ turns.
Six such nucleosomes get coiled and then form
solenoid that looks like coiled telephone wire.
The chromatin is packed to form a solenoid
structure of 30 nm diameter (300A0) and further
supercoiling tends to form a looped structure
called chromatin fiber, which further coils
and condense at metaphase stage to form the
chromosomes. The packaging of chromatin at
higher levels, need additional set of proteins
that are called Non-Histone Chromosomal
proteins (NHC).

Heterochromatin and Euchromatin :
1. Heterochromatin: In eukaryotic cells, some
segments of chromonema/ chromosome
during interphase and early prophase
remain in a condensed state. These region
constitute heterochromatin. This term
was proposed by Heitz. These regions are
localized near centromere, telomeres and
are also intercalated. It is genetically mostly
inactive. It stains strongly and appears
dark. Heterochromatin is 2 to 3 times more
rich in DNA than in the euchromatin.

which are in non-condensed state, constitute
euchromatin. Euchromatic regions stain

much active and fast replicating.
Euchromatin is transcriptionally active,
while heterochromatin is transcriptionally
almost inactive.

equally to the daughter cells. As a carrier of
genetic information, DNA has to perform two
important functions :
a. Heterocatalytic function : When DNA
directs the synthesis of chemical molecules
other than itself, then such functions of
DNA are called heterocatalytic functions.
Eg. Synthesis of RNA (transcription),
synthesis of protein (Translation), etc.

3. Unwinding of DNA molecule:
Now enzyme DNA helicase operates by
breaking weak hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of
‘O. The strands of DNA separate and unwind.
This unwinding is bidirectional and continues
as ‘Y’ shaped replication fork. Each separated
strand acts as template.
The two separated strands are prevented
from recoiling (rejoining) by SSBP (Single
strand binding proteins). SSB proteins remain
attached to both the separated strands so as
to facilate synthesis of new polynucleotide
strands.

b. Autocatalytic function : When DNA
directs the synthesis of DNA itself, then
such function of DNA is called autocatalytic
function. Eg. Replication.
The process by which DNA duplicates
itself is called replication. Through replication,
it forms two copies that are identical to it.
In eukaryotic organisms, replication of
DNA takes place only once in the cell cycle.
It occurs in the S- phase of interphase in the
cell cycle.
DNA replicates through Semiconservative
mode of replication.
The model for Semiconservative replication
was proposed by Watson and Crick, on the basis
of antiparallel and complementary nature of
DNA strands. The process of semicoservative
replication is as below:

1. Activation of Nucleotides:
The four types of nucleotides of DNA i.e.
dAMP, dGMP, dCMP and dTMP are present
in the nucleoplasm. They are activated by ATP
in presence of an enzyme phosphorylase. This
results in the formation of deoxyribonucleotide
triphosphates i.e. dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP.
The process is known as Phosphorylation.

It begins at specific point ‘O’ -origin and

is noly one replicon however in eukaryotes,
there are several replicons in tandem.

Okazaki). Okazaki fragments are joined by
enzyme DNA ligase.

4. Replicating fork:
The point formed due to unwinding and
separation of two strands appear like a Y-shaped
fork, called replicating/ replication fork. The
unwinding of strands imposes strain which is
relieved by super-helix relaxing enzyme.

RNA primers are removed by DNA
polymerase and replaced by DNA sequence with
the help of DNA polymerase-I in prokaryotes
and DNA polymerase-α in eukaryotes.
Finally, DNA gyrase (topoisomerase)
enzyme forms double helix to form daughter
DNA molecules.

5. Synthesis of new strands:
Each separated strand acts as mould or
template for the synthesis of new complementary
strand. It begins with the help of a small RNA
molecule, called RNA primer. RNA primer get
associated with the 3’ end of template strand
and attracts complementary nucleotides from
surrounding nucleoplasm. These nucleotides
molecules bind to the complementary
nucleotides on the template strand by forming
hydrogen bonds (i.e. A=T or T=A; G = C or
C = G). The newly bound nucleotides get
interconnected by phosphodiester bonds,
forming a polynucleotide strand. The synthesis
of new complementary strand is catalyzed
by enzyme DNA polymerase. The new
complementary strand is always formed in 5’3’ direction.

7. Formation of daughter DNA molecules:
At the end of the replication, two daughter
DNA molecules are formed. In each daughter
DNA, one strand is parental and the other
one is totally newly synthesized. Thus, 50%
is contributed by mother DNA. Hence, it is
described as semiconservative replication.
Experimental confirmation :
Semiconservative Replication : In newly
formed DNA molecule, one strand is old
(i.e. conserved) and other strand is newly
synthesized. Thus, it is called Semiconservative
mode of replication.
It is experimentally proved by Matthew
Meselson and Franklin Stahl (1958) by
using equilibrium - density - gradient centrifugation technique.

6. Leading and Lagging strand:
The template strand with free 3’ end is called
leading template and with free 5’ end is called
lagging template. The process of replication
always starts at C-3 end of template strand and
proceeds towards C-5 end. As both the strands
of the parental DNA are antiparallel, new
strands are always formed in 5’ → 3’ direction.

1. Meselson and Stahl in 1958 performed
an experiment to prove semiconservative
nature (mode) of replication.
2. They cultured bacteria E.coli in the medium
containing 14N (light nitrogen) and obtained
equilibrium density gradient band by using
6M CsCl2. The position of this band is
recorded.

One of the newly synthesized strand
develops continously towards replicating
fork is called leading strand. Another new
strand develop discontinuously away from the
replicating fork is called lagging strand.

3. E. coli cells were then tranferred to 15N
medium (heavy isotopic nitrogen) and
allowed to replicate for several generations.
At equilibrium point density gradient band
was obtained, by using 6M CsCl2. The
position of this band is recorded.

Maturation of Okazaki fragments :
DNA synthesis on lagging template takes
place in the form of small fragments, called
Okazaki fragments (named after scientist

4.5 Protein synthesis :
Proteins are very important biomolecules.
They serve as structural components, enzymes
and hormones. The cell needs to synsthesize
new protein molecules. The process of
protein synthesis includes transcription and
translation. The process of copying of genetic
information from one (template) strand of DNA
into a single stranded RNA transcript, is termed
as transcription. During this process, synthesis
of complementary strand of RNA takes place
(Except that the Adenine nitrogen base pairs
with the Uracil base instead of Thymine).
Central Dogma :
Double stranded DNA molecule gives
rise to mRNA which acts as a messenger to
programme the synthesis of a polypeptide
chain (protein). This type of unidirectional
flow of information from DNA to RNA to
protein/ proteins is referred as central dogma
of molecular biology. It was postulated by
F.H.C. Crick in 1958.

4. The heavy DNA (15N) molecule can
be distinguished from normal DNA by
centrifugation in a 6M Cesium chloride
(CsCl2) density gradient. The density
gradient value of 6M CsCl2 and 15N DNA is
almost same. Therefore, at the equilibrium
point 15N DNA will form a band. In this
both the strands of DNA are labelled with
15
N.
5. Such E. coli cells were they transferred to
another medium containing 14N i.e. normal
(light) nitrogen. After first generation,
the density gradient band for 14N 15N was
obtained and its position was recorded.
After second generation, two density
gradient bands were obtained - one at 14N
15
N position and other at 14N position.
6. The position of bands after two generations
clearly proved that DNA replication is

Accordingly enzyme RNA dependent DNA
polymerase, synthesizes DNA from RNA.

polymerase catalyses polymerisation in
5’→3’ direction. So the DNA strand having
3’→5’ polarity acts as template strand. The
other strand of DNA having 5’→3’ polarity
is complementary to template strand. The
sequence of bases in this strand, is same
as in RNA (where Thymine is replaced by
Uracil). It is the actual coding strand. The
information on this strand of DNA is copied
on mRNA. This is called sense strand.
iii. The terminator is located at 3’ end of coding
strand i.e. downstream. It defines the end of
the transcription process.

Can you recall?
1. What is transcription?
2. How many nucleotides are present in a

3. Name the molecule which carries

4. What is mutation?
A. Transcription:
During transcription, information of only
one strand of DNA is copied into RNA. This
strand of DNA acts as template. Enzyme RNA
polymerase catalyses the formation of RNA
transcript.
DNA is located in the nucleoid of
Prokaryotes and in nucleus of Eukaryotes.
DNA transcription takes place in nucleus
in eukaryotes whereas translation occurs
in cytoplasm. DNA transfers information
to m-RNA which then moves to ribosomes.
Transcription occurs in the nucleus during
G1 and G2 phases of cell cycle. DNA has
promotor and terminator sites. Transcription
starts at promotor site and stops at terminator
site. Actually the process of transcription, in
both Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes, involves
three stages viz. Initiation, Elongation and
Termination.
Transcription Unit:
Each transcribed segment of DNA is called
transcription unit. It consists of i. Promotor,
ii. The structural gene, iii. A terminator. Two
strands of DNA in the structural gene show
following features :
i. The promotor is located towards 5’ end of
structural gene i.e. upstream. It is a DNA
sequence that provides binding site for
enzyme RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase
binds to specific Promotor. In prokaryotes,
the enzyme recognizes the promotor by its
sigma factor sub unit.

opposite polarity. DNA dependent RNA

Transcription unit and the gene:
The DNA sequence coding for m-RNA/
t-RNA or r- RNA is defined as a gene. Cistron
is a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide.
A single structural gene in transcription unit
is said to be monocistronic where as a long
segment of DNA having set of various structural
genes in one transcription unit is referred as
polycistronic. Structral genes in eukaryotes
have interrupted non-coding sequences
(introns). The coding sequences or expresssequences are defined are exons. Only exons
appear in procesed mRNA in Eukaryotes.

When RNA polymerase reaches the
terminator signal on the DNA, it leaves DNA
and fully formed mRNA (primary transcript) is
released.
As the mRNA grows, the transcribed region
of DNA molecule becomes spirally coiled and
attains (regains) double helical form.
In bacteria, m-RNA does not require
any processing because it has no introns.
Prokaryotes posses only one type of RNA
polymerase. In eukaryotes, there are three
types RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase-I
transcribes r-RNA. RNA polymerase-II
transcribes m-RNA (primary transcript) and
heterogeneous nuclear RNA (or hnRNA). RNA
polymerase-III is responsible for transcription
of t-RNA and small nuclear RNA (snRNA).

Processing of hnRNA:
In eukaryotes, forms of RNA transcribed
from DNA are called primary transcripts.
Such transcripts undergo changes called
processing or maturation before becoming
functional. Primary transcript is non functional
and contains both exons and introns. During
processing only introns are removed by the
process called splicing.

Do you know ?
1. Many viruses contain RNA as genetic
material and replicate by synthesizing
first the DNA and then form RNA. This
process is called reverse transcription.
Such viruses are known as Retroviruses.
2. e.g. Human immuno deficiency virus
(HIV) is responsible for causing AIDS.
3. In some cases like E.coli, a chain
terminating protein, the rho factor stops
the synthesis of mRNA.

Types of RNA and process of transcription:
In bacteria, there are three types of RNAs : m- RNA provides the encoded message, t- RNA
brings specific amino acid, to the site of translation. r- RNA plays role in providing binding site
to mRNA.
There is single DNA dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all 3 types
of RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promotor and initiates transcription (initiation).
79

Exons are joined in a definite sequence
(order) by DNA ligase enzyme. Heterogeneous
nuclear RNA, undergoes the process of capping
and tailing. In capping, methylated guanosine
tri phosphate is added to 5’ end of hnRNA. In
tailing, polyadenylation take place at 3’end.
It is the fully processed hnRNA, now called
m-RNA. For translation m-RNA is transported
out of the nucleus through nuclear pore.

there must be combination of three consecutive
nitrogen bases that will be sufficient to specify
20 different types of amino acids.
Thus, there would be 64 different codons
(code words) in the dictionary of genetic code
and that each code word has to be a triplet
codon. Every three consecutive nucleotides in
DNA will constitute a triplet codon. Genetic
code is a triplet code, was evidenced first by
Crick (1961) using “frame- shift mutation”.
However, M. Nirenberg and Matthaei were
able to synthesize artificial m-RNA which
contained only one type nitrogenous base
i.e. Uracil (Homopolymer). This synthetic
poly-U sequence was transferred to protein
synthesizing enzymes. A small polypeptide
molecule was produced/ formed by the linking
of phenylalanine molecules. This explains that
UUU codes for phenyl alanine. Later different
homopolymer codons were deciphered. Codons
formed by two or more bases were also tried.

Genetic Code:
It is already known that DNA is a master
molecule of a cell that initiates, guides, regulates
and controls the process of protein synthesis.
To perform this complicated function, it must
carry the requisite information for the synthesis
of proteins. Obviously this information has to
be verily located in the DNA itself. The site for
storing this information lies in the sequence of
nucleotides (i.e. nitrogen bases), as evidenced
by Yanofski and Sarabhai (1964).
About, 20 different types of amino acids are
involved in the process of synthesis of proteins.
DNA molecule has 4 types of nitrogen bases to
identify these 20 different types of amino acids.
Question arises then, how is it possible that 20
types of amino acids are encoded by 4 types of
nitrogen bases?

Dr. Har Gobind Khorana : He devised a
technique for artificially synthesizing m- RNA
with repeated sequences of known nucleotides.
By using synthetic DNA, Dr. Khorana prepared
chains of polyribonucleotides with known
repeated sequences of two or three nucleotides.
eg. CUC UCU CUC UCU.

According to F.H.C. Crick, this
information is stored in the form of coded
language (cryptogram) called genetic code,
that contains code words (codons) each one
specifying (representing) specific amino acid.
Genetic code, therefore, is a collection of base
sequences that correspond to each amino acid.

This resulted in formation of polypeptide
chain having two different amino acids placed
alternately (Leucine and Serine). Similarly
polynucleotide chain with three- nitrogen
base repeats gave polypeptide chain with only
one amino acids. Eg. CUA CUA CUA CUA
(leucine). Later, Severo Ochoa established that
the enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase)
was also helpful in polymerising RNA with
defined sequences in a template- independent
manner (i.e. enzymatic synthesis of RNA).

A single nitrogen base in a codon (singlet
codon) will encode for only four different types
of amino acids. A combination of two nitrogen
bases (doublet codon) will specify only 16
different types of amino acids. A combination
of three nitrogen bases (triplet codon) will
specify 64 different types of amino acids. Hence
G. Gamov (1954) suggested that in a codon,

Finally Nirenberg, Matthaei and Ochoa
deciphered all the 64 codons in the dictionary
of genetic code.

During replication and transcription, a
nucleic acid is copied to form another nucleic
acid. These two processes are based on
complementarity principle. During translation,
genetic information is transferred from a
polymer of nucleotides to a polymer of amino
acids. Here, complementarity principle does
not exist.
It is evident that change in nucleic acid
(genetic material) results in the change in
amino acids of proteins. This clearly explains
that genetic code directs the sequence of amino
acids during synthesis of proteins.

Characterestic of Genetic code:
Genetic code of DNA has
fundamental characteristics –

certain

81

i.

Genetic code is a triplet code: Sequence
of three consecutive bases constitute
codon, which specifies one particular
amino acid. Base sequence in a codon
is always in 5’
3’ direction. In every
living organism genetic code is a triplet
code.

ii.

Genetic code has distinct polarity :
Genetic code shows definite polarity i.e.
direction. It, therefore, is always read in
5’
3’ direction and not in 3’
5’
direction. Otherwise message will change
e.g. 5’ AUG 3’.

iii.

Genetic code is non-overlapping : Code
is non overlapping i.e. each single base is
a part of only one codon. Adjacent codons
do not overlap. If non-overlapping, then
with 6 consequtive bases only two amino
acid molecules will be in the chain. Had it
been overlapping type, with 6 bases, there
would be 4 amino acid molecules in a
chain. Experimental evidence is in favour
of non-overlapping nature.

iv.

Genetic code is commaless : There is
no gap or punctuation mark between
successive/ consecutive codons.
v. Genetic code has degeneracy : Usually
single amino acid is encoded by single
codon. However, some amino acids are
encoded by more than one codons. e.g.
Cysteine has two codons, while isoleucin
has three codons. This is called degeneracy
of the code. Degeneracy of the code is
explained by Wobble hypothesis. Here,
the first two bases in different codons are
identical but the third one, varies.
vi. Genetic code is universal : By and
large in all living organisms the specific
codon specifies same amino acid. e.g.
codon AUG always specifies amino acid
methionine in all organisms from bacteria
up to humans.
vii. Genetic code is non-ambiguous : Specific
amino acid is encoded by a particular
codon. Alternatively, two different amino
acids will never be encoded by the same
codon.
viii. Initiation codon and termination codon:
AUG is always an initiation codon in any

acid methionine. Out of 64 codons, three
codons viz. UAA, UAG and UGA are
termination codons which terminate/ stop
the process of elongation of polypeptide
chain, as they do not code for any amino
acid.

Codon and anticodon : Codon is a part
of DNA e.g. AUG is codon. It is always
represented as 5’ AUG 3’. Anticodon is a
part of tRNA. It is always represented as
3’UAC 5’.

Mutations and Genetic Code:
Mutation is a phenomenon in which
sudden change in the DNA sequence takes
place. It results in the change of genotype
(i.e. character). Along with recombination,
mutation is raw material for evolution as it
also results in variations. During mutation,
possibility of loss (deletion) or gain (insertion/
duplication) of a segment of DNA results in
alteration in the chromosome. Mutation can
also occur due to change in a single base pair
of DNA. This is known as point mutation. Eg.
Sickle cell anaemia (Refer to earlier chapter).
Deletion or insertion of base pairs of DNA
causes frame – shift mutations or deletion
mutation. Insertion or deletion of one or two
bases changes the reading frame from the point
of insertion or deletion. Insertion or deletion
of three or multiples of three bases (insert or
delete) results in insertion or deletion of amino
acids and reading frame remains unaltered
from that point onwards.

It is possible to predict sequence of codon
on mRNA by studying the sequence of
amino acids in a polypeptide chain.

t-RNA- the adapter molecule:
Scientists considered that there has to
be a mechanism in which t-RNA will read the

B. Translation - protein synthesis :
Translation is the mechanism in which
codons of mRNA are translated and specific
amino acids in a sequence form a polypeptide on
ribosomes. All types of proteins are synthesised
by the cell, within itself (i.e. intracellularly).

codon and also simultaniously binds with the
amino acid as amino acid does not have any
special capacity to read the codon. So t-RNA is
considered as an adapter molecule. This role of
tRNA was understood much later.

Amino acids form raw material for
protein synthesis. About 20 different
types of amino acids are known to form
proteins. These are available in the
cytoplasm.
ii. DNA controls synthesis of proteins having
amino acids in specific sequence. This
control is possible through transcription
of m-RNA. Genetic code is specific for
particular amino acid.
iii. RNAs serve as intermediate molecules
between DNA and protein.
iv. Ribosomes serve as site for protein
synthesis. Each ribosome consists of large
and small subunits. These subunits occur
separately in cytoplasm. Only during
protein synthesis, these two subunits get
associated together due to Mg++ ions.

Fig. 4.14: t-RNA - the adapter molecule
Cloverleaf structure (2 dimentional) of
t-RNA possess an anticodon loop that has
bases complementary to the codon. It is called
anticodon. It shows amino acid acceptor end
(3’ end) having unpaired CCA bases (i.e. amino
acid binding site) to which amino acid binds.
For every amino acid, there is specific t- RNA.
Initiator t-RNA is specific for methionine.
There are no t-RNA’s for stop codons. In the
actual structure, the t-RNA molecule looks like
inverted L (3 dimentional structure).

A ribosome has one binding site for m-RNA
and 3 binding sites for t-RNA. They are P
site (peptidy t-RNA site), A site (aminoacyl
– t-RNA site) and E site (exit site). Only first
t- RNA- amino acid complex, directly enters P
site of ribosome.

Can you tell?
Why t-RNA is called as adapter
molecule?

In Eukaryotes, a groove is present between
two subunits of ribosomes. It protects the
Polypeptide chain from the action of cellular
enzymes and also protects mRNA from the
action of nucleases.

Can you recall?
1. Name different types of RNAs.
2. Name the site of protein synthesis.
3. Which molecule carries information of
protein synthesis from gene?
4. Which molecule carries amino acid from
cytoplasm to ribosome?

Mechanism of translation (i.e. synthesis of
polypeptide chain) :
It involves three steps :
i. Initiation, ii. Elongation, iii. Termination
83

1. Initiation of Polypeptide chain :
a. Activation of amino acids is essential
before translation initiates for which
ATP is essential. Small subunit of
ribosome binds (attaches) to the m-RNA
at 5’ end. Initiator codon, AUG is present
on m-RNA which initiates the process of
protein synthesis (translation). Initiator
t- RNA binds with initiation codon
(AUG) by its anticodon (UAC) through
hydrogen bonds. It carries activated
amino acid methionine (in Eukaryotes)
or formyl methionine (in prokaryotes).
b. Now the large subunit of ribosome joins
with the smaller subunit, that requires
Mg++ ions.
c. Initiator charged t-RNA (with activated
amino acid methionine) occupies the Psite of ribosome and A- site is vacant.

tRNA carrying dipeptide now gets
positioned at ‘P’ site of ribosome, making
‘A’ site vacant. At this site, then next
charged tRNA molecule carrying amino
acid will be received. During this process,
first uncharged tRNA is discharged from
E-site.
This process is repeated as amino acids
are added to Polypeptide. It takes less than 0.1
second for formation of peptide bond.
Third charged t-RNA with its amino acid,
arrives at A-site of ribosome. Anticodon and
codon bind by hydrogen bond. Polypeptide
bond is formed. Second t-RNA is discharged
from P-site to E-site and leaves the ribosome.
So the events like arrival of t-RNA- amino acid
complex, formation of peptide bond, ribosomal
translocation and removal of previous tRNA,
are repeated. As ribosome move over the mRNA, all the codons on mRNA are exposed
one by one for translation.

2. Elongations of polypeptide chain :
During this process, activated amino acids
are added one by one to first amino acid
(methionine). Amino acid is activated by
utilising energy form ATP molecule. This
amino acid binds with amino acid binding
site of t-RNA- This results in formation of
t-RNA- amino acid complex.
Addition of Amino acid occurs in 3 Step
cycle a. Condon recognition- Amino acyl t- RNA
molecule enters the ribosome at A-site.
Anticodon binds with the codon by
hydrogen bonds.
b. Amino acid on the first initiator t-RNA
at P-site and amino acid on t-RNA at
A-site join by peptide bond. Here enzyme
Ribozyme acts as a catalyst. At this time
first tRNA at ‘P’ site is kicked off.
c. Translocation- The t- RNA at A-site
carrying a dipeptide at A-site moves
to the P-site. This process is called
translocation. In translocation, both
the subunits of ribosome move along in
relation to tRNA and mRNA. Hence,

3. Termination and release of polypeptide:
At the end of m-RNA, there is a stop
codon (UAA/ UAG/ UGA). It is exposed at the
A-site. It is not read and joined by anticodon
of any t-RNA. The release factor binds to the
stop codon, thereby terminating the translation
process. The Polypeptide is now released in the
cytoplasm.
Two subunits of Ribosome dissociate and
last tRNA is set free in the cytoplasm.
m-RNA also has some additional sequences
that are not translated and are referred as
untranslated regions (UTR). The UTRs are
present at both 5’-end (before start codon) and
at 3’-end (after stop codon). They are required
for efficient translation process.
Finally mRNA is also released in the
cytoplasm. It gets denatured by nucleases
immidiately. Hence mRNA is short -lived.

Genes of a cell are expressed to perform
different functions. For eg. An enzyme beta
galactosidase is synthesised by E-coli. It is
used for hydrolysis of lactose into galactose
and glucose.
Lactose

(b – galactosidase)
+H2O

Galactose + Glucose.

If E.coli bacteria do not have lactose
in the surrounding medium as a source of
energy, then enzyme b-galactosidase is
not synthesised. So, it is the metabolic or
physiological or environmental conditions that
regulate expression of genes. The development
and differentiation of embryo into an adult
organism, is also a result of the coordinated
regulation or expression, of several sets of
genes.
Now one has to understand and know the
mechanism by which the organisms regulate
gene expression in response to changes in the
environment. If so, whether single mechanism
exists for regulation of the expression of
different genes/ sets of genes or different genes
are regulated by different mechanisms.
Certain bacteria like E.coli adapt to their
chemical environment by synthesizing certain
enzymes depending upon the substrate present.
Such adaptive enzyme is called inducible
enzymes. A set of genes will be switched on
when there is necessity to metabolise a new
substrate. This phenomenon is called induction
and small molecule responsible for this, is
known as inducer. It is positive control.

Can you tell?
1. Enlist different steps of protein synthesis.
2. Name the initiator codon of protein
synthesis.
3. Explain in brief the process of initiation
during protein synthesis.
4. Name three binding sites of ribosome.
5. What is translocation?
4.6 Regulation of gene expression:
It is the multistep process by which a gene
is regulated and its product is synthesized.
Thus, gene expression results in the formation
of a Polypeptide. Gene expression process is
regulated at different levels.
In eukaryotes, the regulation can be at
different levels like1. Transcriptional
level (formation of
primary transcript)
2. Processing level ( regulation of splicing)
3. Transport of m-RNA from nucleus to the
cytoplasm.
4. Translational level.

Do you know ?
Repressible regulation of gene is
seen when the end product of a biosynthetic
pathway like amino acid, is provided in the
medium. At this time, internal biosynthesis
of amino acid stops. It is negative control so
the metabolite (amino acid) turns off a set of
genes involved in producing that metabolite.
This is called feedback repression.
85

Lac operon consists of following
components :
1. Regulator gene (repressor gene)
2. Promoter gene
3. Operator gene
4. Structural genes
5. Inducer - It is not a component of
operon.

4.7 Operon concept :
It is a transcriptional control mechanism
of gene regulation. Francois Jacob and Jacques
Monod (1961) explained that metabolic
pathways are regulated as a unit.
For example in E.coli, when lactose sugar
is provided to the culture medium, cell induces
production of three enzymes necessary for
digestion of lactose. The enzymes are :
i.

b-galactosidase : Digests lactose into
galactose and glucose.

ii.

b-galactoside permease : Permits
lactose molecules to enter into the cell.

1. Regulator gene : This gene controls the
operator gene in cooperation with an
inducer present in the cytoplasm. Regulator
gene preceeds the promoter gene. It may not
be present immidiately adjacent to operator
gene. Regulator gene produces a protein
called repressor protein. Repressor binds
with operator gene and represses (stops) its
action. It is called regulator protein.

iii. Transacetylase
(b-Galactoside
acetyltransferease) : Transfers an
acetyl group from acetyl CO-A to
galactoside.

2. Promoter gene : This gene preceeds the
operator gene. It is present adjacent to
operator gene. The promoter gene marks
the site at which the RNA Polymerase
enzyme binds. When the operator gene
is turned on, the enzyme moves over
the operator gene and transcription of
structural genes starts. Promoter gene base
sequence determines which strand of DNA
acts a template.

Synthesis of these three enzymes, is
controlled by a long segment of DNA known
as Operon. It consists of an operator site O and
three structural genes Z, Y and A .The action
of structural genes is regulated by operator
site with the help of a repressor protein.
Repressor protein is produced by the action of
gene i (inhibitor) known as regulator gene.
The gene expression depends on whether
operator is switched on or switched off.

3. Operator gene : It preceeds the structural
genes. This controls the functioning of
structural genes. It lies adjacent to the
Structural genes. When operator gene is
turned on by an inducer, the Structural
genes produce m-RNA. Operator gene is
turned off by a product of repressor gene.

If the operator is switched on, the three genes
z, y and a are transcribed by RNA Polymerase
into a single m-RNA. Each structural gene is
generally known as cistron and the transcribed
long m-RNA covering various cistrons is
known as Polycistronic.

4. Structural gene : When lactose is added
to the E.coli culture, the structural genes
catalyse (produce) m-RNA which in turn
produces polypeptides, on the ribosomes.
The polypeptides formed, act as enzymes
to caltalyse lactose in the cell. There are
3 structural genes in the sequence lac-Z,
lac-Y and lac-A. Enzymes produced are
b-galactosidase, b-galactoside permease
and transacetylase respectively.

Switching on or switching off of the
operator is achieved (acomplished) by a protein
called repressor. When this protein is attached
to the operator and blocks it, the switch is turned
off and structural genes are not expressed.
Lac operon :
Lactose or lac operon of E.coli is inducible
operon. The operon is switched on when a chemical
inducer- lactose is present in the medium.

5. Inducer : It is a chemical in the cytoplasm
(allolactose) which inactivates the
repressor. When lac operon is switched on,
then inducer joins with repressor protein
preventing the binding of repressor to the
operator gene. So the Operator gene is free
and now enzyme RNA polymerase can
move from promoter to structural genes via
operator gene.

Can you tell?
1. What is the role of a repressor gene?
2. Name the different structural genes in
sequence of lac operon.
3. Which molecule does act as inducer
molecule in lac operon?
4. In which condition, lac operon is
switched off?

Role of lactose :
A few molecules of lactose enter into the
cell by an enzyme permease.A small amount
of this enzyme is present even when operon is
switched off. A few molecules of lactose, act as
inducer and bind to repressor. This repressor –
inducer complex fails to join with the operator
gene, which is then turned on. Structural genes
produce all enzymes. Thus, lactose acts as
an inducer of its own break down. When the
inducer level falls, the operator is blocked again
by repressor. So structural genes are repressed/
inactivated again. This is negative feedback.

4.8 Genomics:
The term Genome (introduced by H.Winkler
in 1920) is the total genetic constitution of an
organism. Alternatively, it is a complete copy
of genetic information (DNA) or one complete
set of chromosomes (monoploid or haploid) of
an organism.
The term Genomics (term coined by T.H.
Roderick in 1986) is the study of genomes
through analysis, sequencing and mapping of
genes along with the study of their functions.

Human Genome Project formally began in
1990 and was completed in 2003.The human
genome project is a multinational research
project to determine the genomic structure of
humans. The main aims of project are –
I. Mapping the entire human genome at the
level of nucleotide sequences.
II. To store the information collected from the
project in databases.
III. To develop tools and techniques for analysis
of the data.
IV. Transfer of the related technologies to the
private sectors, such as industries.
V. Taking care of the legal, ethical and social
issues which may arise from project.

The sequencing of yeast, Drosophila and
mouse genome was done in order to facilitate
comparative studies between humans and other
organisms commonly used for genetic studies,
in laboratory. Several additional genomes are
now either actively being sequenced or strongly
considered for sequencing. These include
several microbes, bee, tomato and other crops.
Genomics study may be classified into two
types:
a. Structural genomics: It involves mapping,
sequencing and analysis of genome.
b. Functional genomics: It deals with the
study of functions of all gene sequences
and their expression in organisms.

HGP (Human Genome Project) was closely
associated with rapid development of a new
area in biology, called Bioinformatics. The
work of human genome project has allowed
researchers to begin to understand the blueprint
in building and constructing the human genome.
As researchers learn more about the functions
of genes and proteins, this knowledge will have
a major impact in the fields like Medicine,
Biotechnology and the Life sciences. Therefore
HGP is very important.
Human Genome Project was to provide a
complete and accurate sequence of the 3 billion
DNA base pairs that make up the human
genome and to find out the estimated number
of human genes. Now about 33000 genes have
been estimated to be present in humans.
The project was also aimed to sequence
the genomes of several other organisms such
as bacteia e.g. E.coli, Caenorhabditis elegans
(a free living non-pathogenic nematode),
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Drosophila
(fruit fly), plants (rice and Arabidopsis), Mus
musculus (mouse), etc. Complete genome
sequences of these model organisms will be
useful for comparative studies that will allow
researchers to study gene functions in these
organisms.

Application of genomics:
Structural and functional genomics is used
for different purposes in the improvement of
crop plant, human health and livestock. The
knowledge and understanding acquired from
genomics research can be applied in a number
of different sectors, including medicine,
biotechnology and social sciences. It helps in
the treatment of genetic disorders through gene
therapy.
• Genomics is used in agriculture to develop
transgenic crops having more desirable
characters.
• Genetic markers developed in genomics,
have applications in forensic analysis.
• Genomics can lead to introduce new gene in
microbes to produce enzymes, therapeutic
proteins and even biofuels.
4.9 Human Genome Project :
The human genome project was initiated
in 1990 under the International administration
of the Human Genome Organization (HUGO).
This project was co-ordinated by the US
department of Energy and National institute
of health. Additional contributors included
universities across the United States and
international partners in the United Kingdom,
France, Germany, Japan, India and China. The

DNA fingerprinting technique is based on
identification of nucleotide sequence present
in this wonder molecule. About 99.9% of
nucleotide sequence in all persons, is same.
Only some short sequences of nucleotides
differ from person to person. In the population,
every person shows unusual sequences of 20100 base pairs, which are repeated several
times. They are termed as Variable Number of
Tandem Repeats (VNTRs).
The length of the regions having VNTRs
is different in each individual and hence is the
key factor in DNA profiling. Steps involved in
DNA finger printing are as follows:

The secret of our complexity may lie not
in the number of our genes but how we use
them. It will lead to the understanding of gene
structure and function in other species. Since
we possess many of the genes same as these
of flies, round worms and mice, such studies
will lead to a greater understanding of human
evolution.
Use your brain power
1. What have we learnt from the Human
Genome Project?
2. Why is HGP important?

1. Isolation of DNA: The DNA must be
recovered from the cells or tissues of the
body (host). Only small amount of tissue
like blood, hair roots, skin, etc. is required.
2. Restriction digestion: The isolated DNA
is treated with restriction enzymes. The
restriction enzymes cut the DNA into
small fragments having variable lengths.
This phenomenon is called Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP).

Can you tell?
Do different organisms have the same DNA?
4.10 DNA Fingerprinting:
Genes present on chromosomes are
responsible for determining characters of
the organism as well as for inheritance of
characters. Due to recombination of paternal
and maternal genes, we differ from our parents.
Differences also arise due to infrequent
mutations that occur during gamete formation
(cell division). Due to all these factors, every
individual has its unique genetic make-up,
which may be called its Fingerprint. The
technique developed to identify a person with
the help of DNA restriction analysis, is known
as DNA profiling or DNA fingerprinting. The
technique of finger printing was first given by
British geneticist, Dr. Alec Jeffreys in 1984.

3. Gel electrophoresis: The DNA samples
are loaded for agarose gel electrophoresis
under an electric influence. The DNA
fragments, which are negatively charged
move to the positive pole. The movement
of these fragments depends on length of
the fragments. This results in formation of
bands. dsDNA splits into ssDNA by alkali
treatment.
89

4. Southern blotting: The separated DNA
fragments are transferred to a nylon
membrane or a nitrocellulose filter paper
by placing it over the gel and soaking them
with filter paper overnight.

the nitrocellulose filter paper. Remaining
single stranded DNA probe fragments are
washed off.
7. Photography: The nitrocellulose filter
paper is photographed on an X-ray film by
autoradiography. The film is analysed to
determine the presence of hybrid DNA.

5. Selection of DNA probe: A known sequence
of single- stranded DNA is prepared. It is
called DNA Probe. DNA Probe is obtained
from organisms or prepared by cDNA
preparation method. The DNA probe is
labelled with radioactive isotopes.

Application of DNA fingerprinting
1. In forensic science, DNA finger printing is
used to solve problems of rape and some
complicated murder cases.

6. Hybridization: Probe DNA is added to
the nitrocellulose filter paper containing
host DNA. The single-stranded DNA
probe pairs with the complementary base
sequence of the host DNA strand. As a
result DNA-DNA hybrids are formed on

2. DNA finger printing is used to find out the
biological father or mother or both, of the
child, in case of disputed parentage.
3. DNA finger printing is used in pedigree
analysis in cats, dogs, horses and humans.

As far as origin of life is considered, it has
remained an enigma for intellectuals at all
times. Despite of advancements in various
fields like biochemistry, astrobioloy, geography,
molecular biology, etc. scientists are unable to
ascertain the truth. Various theories and
hypotheses have been proposed to find the
probable answer to this question.

d. Theory of biogenesis :
According to this theory, living organisms
are always produced from pre-existing living
forms, by process called reproduction.
Theory of biogenesis however could not
explain origin of first life on earth but could
explain only the continuity of life.

a. Theory of special creation :
It is the oldest theory and is based on
religious belief without any scientific proof. It
states that all living organisms are created by a
super-natural power.
b. Cosmozoic theory/Theory of Panspermia:
This theory advocates that life did not arise
on the planet Earth. It may have descended to
the earth from other planets in the form of
spores or micro-organisms, called cosmozoa/
panspermia. Recently, NASA has reported
fossils of bacteria-like organisms on a piece of
Martian rock recovered from Antarctica.

5.2 Chemical Evolution of Life (Self assembly
theory of origin of life ) :
According to this theory, life originated on
earth by combinations of several chemicals
through constant chemical reactions over a
long period of time. This theory is also called
self assembly theory of origin of life or
biochemical origin of life.
This theory was first formulated by Haeckel
but later developed by the Russian scientist
Alexander I. Oparin (1924) and British biologist
J. B. S. Haldane (1929). The process of
chemical evolution can be divided into
following steps :

c. Theory of spontaneous generation
(Abiogenesis) :
According to this theory, life originated
from non-living material spontaneously. This
theory was disproved by Louis Pasteur.
94

a. Origin of Earth and Primitive
atmosphere:
The origin of universe was explained by
the Big-Bang theory of Georges Lemaitre
(1931). According to this theory the Universe
originated about 20 billion years ago by a
single huge titanic explosion. As the universe
expanded, the temperature decreased and
various galaxies of solid objects were formed.
Milky Way is one such galaxy of which our
solar system is one small part. Earth is one of
the planets of solar system and originated about
4.6 billion year ago. When formed, it was a
rotating cloud of hot gases and cosmic dust
called Nebula. The condensation and cooling
resulted in stratification with heavier elements
like nickel and iron passing to the core and
lighter ones like helium, hydrogen, nitrogen,
oxygen, carbon, etc. remaining on the surface.
They formed the atmosphere of the earth. The
primitive atmosphere of the earth was quite
different from the present one and it was of a
reducing type, devoid of free oxygen.

rays, radiations, lightening and volcanic
activities, the early molecules of hydrocarbons,
ammonia, methane and water underwent
reactions like condensation, polymerisation,
oxidation and reduction. These reactions
resulted in formation of simple molecules like
monosaccharides, amino acids, purines,
pyrimidines, fatty acids, glycerol, etc. All these
simple organic molecules accumulated at the
bottom of water bodies. Haldane described it
as the ‘‘hot dilute soup’’ or ‘‘primitive broth’’.
It did not show any degradation due to absence
of free oxygen and enzymes.
d. Formation of complex organic molecules:
The primitive broth was neutral and free
from oxygen. Polymerisation took place and
simple organic molecules aggregated to form
new complex organic molecules like
polysaccharides, fats, proteins, nucleosides
and nucleotides. Polymerisation of amino acids
formed protoproteins which later formed
proteins. Formation of protein molecules is
considered as landmark in the origin of life.
Proteins (enzymes) accelerated the rate of other
chemical reactions.

b. Formation of ammonia, water and
methane:
Primitive atmosphere was very hot. As it
slowly cooled, the lighter elements started to
react with each other. The early atmosphere
was rich in hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and
sulphur of which hydrogen being more active,
it reacted with other elements to form chemicals
on earth like CH4, NH3, H2O and H2S.

e. Formation of Nucleic acids :
Nucleotides may have been formed by the
reaction between phosphoric acid, sugar and
nitrogenous bases (purines and pyrimidines).
Number of nucleotides join together to form
nucleic acids (RNA, DNA). Nucleic acids
acquired self-replicating ability which is a
fundamental property of living form.

c. Formation of simple organic molecules :
As temperature of the earth decreased,
steam condensed into water that resulted in
heavy rain fall and the earth gradually cooled.
Rain water got accumulated on the land to
form rivers, streams, lakes, seas and oceans.
The atmosphere then did not contain ozone
layer and thus ultra-violet radiations reached
the surface of earth directly. Under the influence
of available energy sources such as ultra-violet

f. Formation of Protobionts or Procells :
Nucleic acids along with inorganic and
organic molecules formed the first form of life
called protobionts. Protobionts are the
prebiotic chemical aggregates having some
properties of living system.

95

Urey provided the first experimental evidence
in support of chemical evolution theory of
Oparin.
They designed a glass-apparatus called
spark-discharge apparatus.
The apparatus (Fig. 5.2) was first sterilized
and evacuated. Methane, ammonia and
hydrogen gases were pumped in the proportion
of 1:2:2 into the glass chamber. A tube carrying
water vapour was also connected to the
chamber. Lightning effect was mimicked by
electric discharge carbon arc spark in the
chamber. Process of evaporation and
precipitation was also simulated by the use of
heating mantle and condenser respectively.
The mixture of CH4, NH3, H2 was exposed
continuously to electric discharge for several
days causing the gases to interact, after which
these were condensed. The liquid collected in
the U-tube turned brown. Chemical analysis of
this liquid reported the presence of simple
organic compounds. (urea, amino acids, lactic
acid, etc). This experiment strongly supports
that the simple molecules present in the earth’s
early atmosphere combined to form the organic
building blocks of life.

Protobionts are formed due to coacervation
i.e. aggregation of organic molecules. Oparin
(1924) called them coacervates and Sidney
Fox called protenoids or microspheres.

Coacervates

Fig. 5.1 : Coacervates
Coacervates are colloidal aggregations of
hydrophobic proteins and lipids (lipoid
bubbles). Coacervates grew in size by taking
up material from surrounding aqueous medium.
As they grew, they became thermodynamically
unstable and split into smaller units, comparable
to daughter cells of budding organisms.
Microspheres are protenoids formed from
colloidal hydrophilic complexes surrounded by
water molecules. These bodies may have outer
double-membrane, like primitive cell. Diffusion
and osmosis may have occurred across the
membrane. They were more stable than
coacervates. Coacervates and microspheres
were non-living colloidal aggregations of lipids
and proteinoids respectively. They had some
basic properties of living cells, such as growth
and division. These colloidal aggregations
turned into first primitive living system called
eobionts or protocell.

RNA World Hypothesis :
Oparin Haldane theory and Miller Urey
experiment gives us an understanding that
pathway of origin of life on earth goes from
non-living to living. ‘Like begets like’
necessitates presence of stable genetic material
and cellular machinery to carry out routine
activities essential for survival.
We are also aware that certain proteins
which we call enzymes, catalyse the chemical
reactions in the cell. It was in 1980 that Sidney
Altman and Thomas Cech independently found
out that RNAs can also act as biocatalysts.
These catalytic RNAs are called as Ribozymes.
For this discovery, Altman and Cech earned
Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1989.
This discovery provided important support
for RNA World hypothesis. The hypothesis
suggests that early life must have been based
exclusively on nucleic acids, most probably
RNA. It was first proposed by Carl Woese,
Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel in 1960, long
before discovery of ribozymes.
Fact is that RNA is found abundantly in all
living cells, it is structurally related to DNA
and chains of RNA can evolve or undergo
mutations, replicate and catalyse reactions, all
support this hypothesis.
RNA selfreplicates
(via ribozymes)

RNA forms

sources

Besides, biomolecules like Acetyl-Co-A
have a nucleotide in their molecular structure.
Major evidence is existence of ribosome (the
protein assembly unit) in the cell. In ribosomes,
translation process is catalysed by RNA. (Refer
chapter- Molecular Basis of Inheritance).
These molecules might have undergone
repeated replication and mutation forming
varieties of RNA molecules with varying sizes
and catalytic properties. Eventually they might
have developed their own protein coats and
machinery to survive the assembly of primitive
cell. In due course, a double stranded stable
structure, the DNA, might have been formed
and thus continued the ongoing journey which
resulted in rich biodiversity on earth.
5.3 Organic Evolution :
Evolution (Latin word, e = from; volvere =
to roll) means the act of unrolling or unfolding
of nature. It brings about orderly changes from
one form to another. These changes result in
descendants becoming different from the
ancestors.
Organic evolution can be defined as slow,
gradual, continuous and irreversible changes
through which the present day complex forms
of the life developed (or evolved) from their
simple pre-existing forms.

RNA catalyses
protein synthesis

According to Charles Darwin, evolution
is ‘descent with modification’. You have
already studied the Lamarck’s theory of
inheritance of acquired characters in 10th std.
According to this theory, the traits are acquired
due to internal force, changes in environment,
new needs and the use and disuse of organs.
After several generations, it gives rise to new
species.

This theory was disproved by a German
biologist August Weismann, who cut the tails

21 generations. He concluded that variations
produced in somatic cells (somatoplasm) are
not inherited while variations produced in germ
cells (germplasm) are inherited to next
generation and he proposed the theory of
Germplasm.

potential of humans is greater than others. This
resulted in multiplication of human population
without corresponding increase in the food
supply. This increase lead to competition and
struggle for existence of human species.
He was also influenced by plant/animal
breeders who by using artificial selection,
altered the characteristic of cultivated plant
and domestic animals.

5.4 Darwinism :
Before darwinism, several theories were
proposed to explain the process organic
evolution. Few of them are explained below :

Darwinism is based on five main postulates:

Lamarck (1809) published theory of origin
of acquired characters. Which was then ruled
out.

1. Overproduction (Prodigality of nature)
- It is the natural tendency to produce more
number of progeny in geometric ratio, for
perpetuation of the species. He observed
prodigality potential many species of
plants and animals e.g. Salmon fish
produces about 28 lakh eggs in a single
season. In a span of 750 years single pair
of elephants would produce 19,000,000
elephants. However the size of given
species in a given area remains relatively
constant because of fluctuations that occur
seasonally.
2. Struggle for existence - Tendency of over
production leads to the struggle for
existence between the members of
population for limited supply of food or to
overcome
adverse
environmental
conditions or for a space or to escape from
enemies etc.
3. Organic variations - The variations speak
for all kinds of differences that occur in
morphology, physiology, nutrition, habit
behavioural
patterns
etc.
Darwin
recognized these variations as raw material
for evolution. Variations were observed
among members of the same species and
even in different species.
4. Natural selection - Organic variations can
serve as evidence that for the some
organisms have better adapted to survive
under existing environmental conditions
than the others. In the struggle for existence
organisms with favourable variations are

Fig. 5.4 : Charles Darwin (1809 - 1882)
Darwnism (theory of origin of species by
Natural Selection).
Charles Darwin as a naturalist travelled
extensively the world over from 27th December
1831 to October 1836 and returned to England.
Based on his collections of living and fossil
material he published a book ‘‘The origin of
species by Natural Selection’’ in 1859. Before
publishing his book, he was very much
influenced by C. Lyell (Geologist) who pointed
out that the natural forces that existed in the
past are same as those existing at present.
Darwin observed that the natural forces resulted
in the changes in the earth’s crust along South
America. He observed variety of strange plants
and animal in Galapagos islands and other
nearby islands in the Archipealago in terms of
variations between the tortoises and finches.
Similar observations were also made by
Wallace. He was also influenced by R. Malthus,
an Economist, who worked on human
population mentioning that the reproductive
98

e. According to natural selection new species
are formed by gradual accumulation of
useful variations. If it is so, then their
should be intermediate forms. But in most
cases intermediate form were not
recognised. Moreover, Darwinism also
could not explain existence of neutral
flowers and the sterility of hybrids.

selected by the nature while those with
unfavourable variations perish. According
to Darwin, the principle by which useful
variations are preserved by nature, is called
‘Natural Selection’. H. Spencer named
this process as ‘survival of fittest’.
5. Origin of new species (speciation) - As
favourable variations are transmitted from
generation to generation, successive
generations become better adapted to
environment. Gradually these adaptation
with few new modification become fixed
in the life cycle and finally giving rise to a
new species.

5.5 Mutation Theory :
This theory was proposed by Hugo de Vries
(1901), after the rediscovery of Mendel’s work
(1900). He proposed this theory based on his
observations on seven generations of the plantevening primrose (Oenothera Lamarckiana).
He found that though most of the offsprings
resembled their parents in many characters,
some of the offsprings show the appearance of
sudden or spontaneous variation clearly
different from the phenotypic expression of the
parent. These sudden variations were called
mutations or discontinuous variations. The
variant offsprings produced variants and not
normal plants i.e. these changes were
inheritable. He also observed that some variants
also produced more variations. He noted that
these sudden changes are inheritable, and
proposed the Mutation theory.

Evidences Darwinism include - (i)
Evolution of long-necked Giraffe to pluck and
eat more leaves from tall trees and woody
climbers. This adaptation became fixed in the
life for survival. The Giraffe borne tall could
survive in famine heat areas. This adaptation
was transmitted to their offspring. This is how,
present long-necked Giraffe came to existence.
(ii) Black colour peppered moths evolved
gradually as new species. (iii) DDT resistance
in mosquitoes-intensive DDT spraying
destroyed all types of mosquitoes. However
some mosquitoes developed resistance to DDT
and survived the on slaught of DDT spray.
Such resistant mosquitoes survived and
reproduce giving rise to more resistant
offspring.

The main features of mutation theory are :
•

Mutations are large, sudden and
discontinuous variations in a population.

•

These changes are inheritable.

•

Mutations provide the raw material for
organic evolution. ‘

•

Mutation may be useful or harmful. Useful
mutations are selected by nature.

b. He also did not distinguish somatic and
germinal variation and considered all
variations are heritable.

•

Accumulation of these mutations over a
period of time leads to the origin and
establishment of new species.

c. He did not explain the ‘arrival of the
fittest’. d. He also did not explain the cause,
origin and inheritance of variations and of
vestigial organs, nor he could explain the
extinction of species.

•

Harmful mutation may persist or get
eliminated by nature.

Drawbacks and Objections to Darwnism a. He considered minute fluctuating variation
as principal factors which are not heritable
and not part of evolution.

99

Objections to Mutation Theory :

•

All individuals of the some species
constitute a population. The populations
occur in small groups of ‘interbreeding
populations’. Such small interbreeding
group of a population is referred as
‘Mendelian population’.

•

The total genetic information encoded in
sum total of genes in a Mendelian
population is called gene pool. Simply,
gene pool means the total number of genes
of all individuals in a population. The
gametes produced by individual furnish a
pool of genes of next generation from which
the genes will be selected.

•

The migration of population effectively
alter the gene pool. The gene pool also
changes due to replacement of one
generation by another in the Mendelian
population. Thus any change in the gene
pool affects population.

•

Genes are arranged linearly on the
chromosome having definite positions.
According to Mendel, every gene that
influences a trait has two alleles. The
proportion of an allele in the gene pool, to
the total number of alleles at a given locus,
is called gene frequency.

•

Modern synthetic theory comprises five
main factors that are broadly divided into
three main concepts like - i. genetic
variations caused due to various aspects
of mutation, recombination and migration.
ii. natural selection and iii. isolation, for
explaining the evolution of species.

i. The large and discontinuous variation
observed by Hugo de Vries were actually
due to chromosomal aberrations were as
gene mutations usually bring about minor
changes.
ii. Rate of mutation is very slow as compared
to the requirement of evolution.
iii. Chromosomal aberrations have little
significance in evolution as they are quite
unstable.
Always Remember
1. According to Darwin variations are small
and directional where as mutations are
large, sudden, random and direction less.
2. Darwin believed that the gradual
inheritable variations over a long period
of time, lead to Speciation (formation of
new species) while de Vries believed that
mutations are the cause of speciation.
3. A single step large mutation is called
saltation.
5.6 Modern Synthetic Theory of Evolution :
• It is the result of true synthesis of all
biological discipline. Studies pertaining to
genetical,
ecological,
anatomical,
geographical, palaeontological etc. were
persued to explain mechanism of evolution.
Also due importance was given to both
mutations and natural selection.

R. Fischer, J. B. S. Haldane, T. Dobzhansky
J. Huxley, E. Mayr, Simpson, Stebbins,
Fisher, Sewall Wright, Medel, T. H. Morgan
etc. are the main contributors of modern
theory of evolution.
Stebbins in his book discussed five key
factors such as gene mutations, mutations
in the chromosome structure and number,
genetic recombinations natural selection
and reproductive isolation, contributed in
the evolution of new species.

a. Genetic variations : The change in gene
and gene frequencies, is known as genetic
variation. Genetic variations are caused by
following factors :
i. Gene Mutation : Sudden permanent
heritable change is called mutation.
Mutation can occur in the gene, in the
chromosome and in chromosome number.
Mutation that occurs within the single gene,

100

b. Duplication : Genes are repeated or
doubled in number on chromosome.
c. Inversion : A particular segment of
chromosome is broken and gets
reattached to the same chromosome in
an inverted position due to 1800 twist.
There is no loss or gain of gene
complement of the chromosome.
d. Translocation
:
Transfer
(transposition) of a part of chromosome
or a set of genes to a non-homologous
chromosome is called translocation. It
is effected naturally by the transposons
present in the cell.

is called point mutation or gene mutation.
This leads to the change in the phenotype of
the organism, causing what is called
variation.
ii. Genetic recombination : In sexually
reproducing organisms, during gamete
formation, exchange of genetic material
occurs between non-sister chromatids of
homologous chromosomes. This is called
crossing over. It produces new genetic
combinations which result in variation.
Fertilization between opposite mating
gametes leads to various recombinations
resulting into the phenotypic variations
causing change in the frequencies of alleles.
iii. Gene flow : Gene flow is movement of
genes into or out of a population. Gene
movement may be in the form of migration
of organism, or gametes (dispersal of
pollens)
or
segments
of
DNA
(transformation). Gene flow also alters
gene frequency causing evolutionary
changes.
iv. Genetic drift : Any random fluctuation
(alteration) in allele frequency, occurring in
the natural population by pure chance, is
called genetic drift. For example, when the
size of a population is severely reduced due
to natural disasters like earthquakes, floods,
fires, etc. cause elimination of particular
alleles from a population. Smaller
populations have greater chances for
genetic drift. It will result in the change in
the gene frequency. Genetic drift is also an
important factor for evolutionary change.
v. Chromosomal
aberrations
: The
structural, morphological change in
chromosome due to rearrangement, is
called chromosomal aberrations. It changes
the genes arrangement (order or sequence)
that results in the variation. Chromosomal
aberrations occur due to a. Deletion : Loss of genes from
chromosome.

Fig. 5.5 : Chromosomal aberrations
b. Natural selection :
According to Darwin, natural selection is
the main driving force behind the evolution.
This holds that genetic variations rise within
the population. The ‘fittest’ will be at the
selective advantage and will be more likely to
produce offsprings than the rest, as the ‘fit’
continues to enjoy greater survival and
reproductivity, new species will eventually
evolve.
Alternatively, natural selection is the
process by which better adapted organisms
grow and produce more number of offsprings
in the population.
It brings about evolutionary changes by
favouring differential reproduction of genes
that bring about changes in gene frequency
from one generation to next generation.

101

Selection against harmful mutations leads
to a mutation balance in which allele frequency
of harmful recessives remain constant
generation after generation.

Fig. 5.6 : Natural selection (Biston betularia
and Biston carbonaria)
Natural selection encourages those genes
or traits that assure highest degree of adaptive
efficiency between population and its
environment. Industrial melanism is one of
the best example for natural selection. In Great
Britain, before industrilisation (1845) grey
white winged moths (Biston betularia) were
more in number than black-winged moth
(Biston carbonaria).
These moths are nocturnal and during day
time they rest on tree trunk. White-winged
moth can camouflaged (hide in the background)
well with the lichen covered trees that helped
them to escape from the predatory birds. on
other hand, the black-winged moth resting on
lichen covered tree trunks were easy victims
for the predatory birds and their number was
reduced. During industrial revolution, large
number of industries came up in Great Britain.
The industries released black sooty smoke that
covered and killed the lichens growing on tree
and turn the tree black due to pollution.
This change become an advantage to the
black-winged moth that camoflaged well with
the black tree trunks and their number increased
while the white-winged moth become victims
to predatory birds due to which their number
reduced. Thus natural selection has resulted in
the establishment of a phenotypic traits in
changing the environmental conditions.

c. Isolation :
Isolation is the separation of the population
of a particular species into smaller units which
prevents interbreeding between them. Some
barrier which prevents gene flow or exchange
of genes between isolated populations, is called
isolating mechanism.
Number of isolating mechanisms are
operated in nature and therefore divergence
and speciation may occur. The isolating
mechanisms are of two types namely,
geographical isolation and reproductive
isolation.
I. Geographical Isolation :
It is also called as physical isolation. It
occurs when an original population is divided
into two or more groups by geographical
barriers such as river, ocean, mountain, glacier
etc. These barriers prevent interbreeding
between isolated groups.
The separated groups are exposed to
different kinds of environmental factors and
they acquired new traits by mutations. The
separated populations develop distinct gene
pool and they do not interbreed. Thus, new
species have been formed by geographical
isolation. E.g. Darwin’s Finches.
II. Reproductive Isolation :
Reproductive isolations occurs due to
change in genetic material, gene pool and
structure of genital organs. It prevents
interbreeding between population.
Types of Isolating Mechanisms :
A. Pre-mating or pre-zygotic isolating
mechanism : This mechanism prevent
fertilization and zygote formation.
i. Habitat isolation or (Ecological isolation)
: Members of a population living in the
same geographic region but occupy
separate habitats so that potential mates do
not meet.

102

ii. Seasonal or temporal isolation : Members
of a population living in the same
geographic region but are sexually mature
at different years or different times of the
year.
iii. Ethological isolation : Due to specific
mating behaviour the members of
population do not mate.
iv. Mechanical Isolation : Members of two
population have difference in the structure
of reproductive organs.
B. Post-mating or Post-zygotic barriers :
i. Gamete mortality - Gametes have a
limited life span. Due to one or the other
reasons, if union of the two gametes does
not occur in the given time, it results in the
gamete mortality.
ii. Zygote mortality - Here, egg is fertilized
but zygote dies due to one or the other
reasons.
iii. Hybrid sterility - Hybrids develop to
maturity but become sterile due to failure of
proper gametogenesis (meiosis). e.g. Mule
is an intergeneric hybrid which is sterile.

5.7 Mechanism of organic evolution :
One has to give the importance to the
population while considering the mechanism of
evolution. It is the population that evolves and
not its individual members. Individual’s role is
to pass its genetic variation to its offspring.
The following are the basic processes
which bring about evolution viz. Mutations,
gene recombination, gene flow (migration),
genetic drift, natural selection, isolation and
speciation.
Mutations - These are permanent heritable
changes in the genetic material of an organism.

Mutations are already described earlier in this
chapter. Gene mutations produce new alleles
which are added to gene pool.
Gene recombination - These are variation
produce due to coming together of alleles
during
sexual
reproduction.
Gene
recombinations occur due to random union of
gametes, anaphasic separation of chromosomes
and crossing over.
Gene flow - It is the transfer of gene during
interbreeding of populations that are genetically
different. As explained earlier in this chapter
gene flow is due to emigration and imigration.
Its brings about changes in the allele frequency.
Genetic drift - Any alternation in allete
frequency in the natural population by chance,
is called genetic drift. Concept of genetic drift
was first given Sewall wright, hence, called as
Sewall wright effect. For example, elimination
of a particular allele from a population due to
events like accidental death prior to mating of
an organism. Genetic drifts are random or
directionless. The effect of genetic drift is more
significant in small population than in large
population. Due to genetic drift, some alleles of
a population are lost or reduced by chance and
some others may be increased. Some time, a
few individuals become isolated from the large
population and they produce new population in
new geographical area. The allele frequency of
new population become different. The original
drifted population (i.e. colonizing ancestor/
pioneer) becomes ‘founders’ and the effect is
called founder effect.
A bottle neck effect is seen when much of a
population is killed due to a natural disaster
and only a few remaining individuals are left to
begin a new population.
Natural selection - It is a process by which
better adapted individuals with useful
variations are selected by nature and leave
greater or more number of progenies
(Differential reproduction).

103

Number of Individuals

Type of Natural selection :
a. Stabilizing selection : (Balancing selection)
1. Here more individuals of a population
acquired a mean character value.

3. It reduces variations.
4. It does not lead to evolutionary change but
tend to maintain phenotypic stability within
population, therefore, it is described as
stabilizing selection.
5. Genetically stabilizing selection represents
a situation where a population is adapted to
its environment.

b. Directional selection :
1. In this type, more individuals acquired
value other than the mean character value.
2. Naural selection acts to eliminate one of
the extremes of the phenotypic range and
favour the other. e.g. systematic elimination
of homozygous recessives.

c. Disruptive Natural selection :
1. Here more number of individuals acquire
peripheral character value at both ends of
the distribution curve.
2. Nature select extreme phenotypes and
eliminate intermediate. Hence two peaks
are formed in distribution of traits.
3. This kind of selection is rare.
4. It ensures the effect on the entire genepool
of a population, considering all mating
types or systems.
5. Example - It was observed in the different
beak size of African seed cracker finches.
The birds have different size of beak and
they feed on seeds. The avilable seeds were
of two kinds small and large sized seeds.
Large beak sized birds feeds on large seeds
while small beak sized birds feed on small
seeds and their number was increased.
Intermediate beak sized birds are unable to
feed on either type of seeds so their
population was decreased gradually and
then eliminated by natural selection.

3. Directional selection operates for many
generations, it results in an evolutionary
trend within a population and shifting a
peak in one direction.
4. e.g. Industrial melanism, DDT resitant
mosquito etc.

2. It tends to favour the intermediate forms
and eliminate both the phenotypic extreme.
For e.g. More number of infants with
intermediate weight survive better as
compare to those who are over-weight or
under-weight.

Isolation - It is separation of a single
interbreeding population into subunits.
Isolation restricts gene flow between descrete
(non continuous population due to different
barriers like geographical barriers. (This part
is already explained in detail earlier in this
chapter)
Speciation - The sub units of single
interbreeding
population due to the
geographical barriers like river, mountains,
desert, sea etc. become isolated in such a way
that their interbreeding is prevented. This will
finally lead to origin of new species (i.e.
speciation). (Discussed in detail ahead in this
chapter).
5.8 Hardy-Weinberg’s principle :
It is also known as Hardy-Weinberg’s
equilibrium law. The law states that ‘at
equilibrium point both the gene (allele)
frequency and geneotypic frequency remain
constant from generation to generation’. It
occurs only in the diploid, sexually reproducing,
large, free interbreeding population in which
mating is random and no selection or other
factors are present for changing the allele
frequency. e.g. A single locus has two alleles (A
and a). The frequencies of these allele are p
and q respectively. The allele frequency for any
locus is always one. i.e. P + Q = 1. The genotypic
frequencies of both the alleles are represented
by (p + q)2 = 1. The binomial expansion of this
is P2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 i.e. AA=P2, aa=q2 and for
2Aa= 2pq.
Hence P2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 This is a binomial
expansion of (p + q)2.
This can be explained by punnet square as
follow.
Hybrid A a
A (p)
a (q)
Hybrid
Aa

A (p)

AA (p2)

Aa (pq)

a (q)

Aa (pq)

aa (q2)

Like allele frequency, the genotypic
frequencies together are also equal to 1.

There are few factors such as gene
migration (gene flow), genetic drift, mutation,
genetic recombinations, natural selection, nonrandom mating, etc. which affect or change the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrilium,
If these factors do not occur in the
population, then population is genetically
stable or non evolving population.
Can you tell?
In which conditions the gene frequency
of a population will remain constant?
5.9 Adaptive Radiation :
The process of evolution which results in
transformation of original species to many
different varieties, is called, adaptive radiation.
Darwin’s Finches is one of the best example
of adaptive radiation. During his visit to
Galpagos Islands. Charls Darwin also noticed
a variety of small birds. These birds are called
Darwin’s finches.

Fig. 5.10 : Darwin’s finches
Darwin concluded that the American main
land species of bird was the original one from
which they migrated to the different islands of
Galpagos. They adapted to the different
environmental conditions of these islands.
From original seed eating features many other
forms with altered beaks evolved into
insectivorous features.
Another example of adaptive radiation is
Australian Marsupials. In Australia, there are
many marsupial mammals who evolved from
common ancestor.

105

2. Moulds : These are the hardened
encasements formed in the outer parts
of organic remains which later decayed
leaving cavities. Body parts of plants or
animals later decays but the impression
still remains and becomes permanent.
For example Foot – prints are formed
in this manner.

Can you tell?
1. What is carbon dating and how does it
work ?
2. What is fossils ?
3. What is Homologous organs ?
4. What is Embryology ?
5.10 Evidences of organic evolution :
The theory of organic evolution states that
the present day complex organisms have
originated from earlier simpler forms of life.
The process of evolution is supported by
evidences provided by various branches of
biology such as : Palaeontology, comparative
anatomy, embryology and molecular biology.
A. Palaeontology : The study of ancient life
with help of fossils is called palaeontology.
Fossils are the dead remains of plants
and animals that lived in past in various
geological layers.
• The study of fossils provides the most
convincing and direct evidence of
evolution.
• Fossils are formed in sedimentary rocks,
amber (yellowish fossils resin), ice, peat
bogs etc.
• During fossilization, the primitive forms
of organisms occupy the older, lower
layers and the advanced forms occupy
the upper, more recent layers of the
earth.
Types of fossils :
1. Actual remains : These are most
common type of fossils. The plants,
animals and human bodies got
embedded in permafrost of arctic or
alpine snow remain preserved in the
actual state, e.g. Wooly Mammoth
in Siberia. Amber or hardened resin
contains preserved bodies of many
insects and arthropods.

3. Cast : They are hardened pieces of
mineral matter deposited in the cavities
of moulds.
4. Compressions : Internal structure is
absent but a thin carbon film indicates
the outline of external features.
Significance of Palaeontology :
1. It is useful in reconstruction of phylogeny.
2. It helps in studying various forms and
structures of extinct animals.
3. It provides record of missing link
between two groups of organsims.
4. It helps in the study of habits of extinct
organisms.
5. Palaeontology provides the following
types of evidences.
Connecting link (missing link) :
These are fossil forms transitional or
intermediate between two groups of organisms.
It shows some characters to both the groups.
Thus it indicate the evolutionary line Seymouria
(between amphibians and reptiles). e.g.
Archaeopteryx (between reptiles and birds).
Archaeopteryx lithographica :
It is fossilized crow size toothed bird found
from jurassic rocks in Germany. It is known as
missing link between reptiles and birds because
it shows characters of both.
Reptilian characters :
1. Presence of long tail, claws and scales
on the body.
2. Single headed ribs.
3. Abdominal ribs are present which look
like ribs of crocodile.
4. Jaws with homodont teeth.

106

5. Sternum without keel.
6. Bones are solid (nonpneumatic).
7. Hind limbs had four clawed digits.

Do you know ?
First fossil of Archaeopteryx was found in
Jurassic rocks of Bavaria. It was discovered
in 1861 and preserved in British museum by
Andreas Wanger.
The second specimen found in 1877,
known as Archaeornis, is kept in the Berlin
museum.

2. Forelimbs are modified into wings.
3. Jaws are modified into beak.
4. Skull bone is completely fused.
5. Large rounded cranium.
6. Cranium with large orbits and a single
condyle.
7. Limb bones are bird like.
8. Hind limbs with four toes first toe is
opposible.

B. Morphology : Morphology deals with
study of external structures while, anatomy
deals with study of internal structures. From
comparative study of morphology and anatomy
we can understand the evolutionary aspects
in the form of homologous, analogous and
vestigeal organs.
a. Homologous organs : Homologous organs
are those organs, which are structurally
similar but perform different functions.
For example :
1. Forelimbs of vertebrates such as
lizzard, bird, bat, horse, whale and man,
Humerus
Radius
Ulna

Thus from the above study it is very clear
that birds evolved from reptiles. Huxley justified
this by calling birds as glorified reptiles.

b. Analogous organs : Analogous organs
are those which are structurally dissimilar
but functionally similar. These organs
have external superficial similarity due
to similar functions but they are different
anatomically.
For e.g. wings of butterfly (insects) and of
birds look superficially alike but they are
no anatomically similar structures though
they perform similar functions.
Other examples of analogous organs.
1. Eye of the octopus (mollusca) and of
mammals. They differ in their retinal
position, structure of lens and origin of
different eye parts.

Insect

er s

Bird

Fig. 5.13 : Analogous organs
c. Vestigeal organs : (Rudimentary organs)
Vestigeal organs are imperfectly developed
and non-functional, degenerate structures
which were functional in some related
and other animals or in ancestors. The
vestigeal organs are no longer required by
the organism but indicate the relationship
with those organisms were these organs are
fully developed.
Examples : Human beings show some
vestigeal organs like 1. Presence of vestigeal nictititating
membranes.
2. Presence of wisdom teeth (third molars).
3. Coccyx (tail bone) : It is greatly reduced
in man since the tail is of no use due to
erect posture.

2)

Plica semilumaris

2. The flippers of penguins (birds) and
dolphins (mammals).
3. Sweet potato (root modification) and
potato (stem modification) store food
in form of starch.
Analogous organs leads to convergent
evolution i.e. different organisms shows same
superficial structural similarities due to similar
functions or habitat. These organs do not help
to trace the common ancestry. Thus analogous
organs do not have significant role in evolution.

2. Vertebrate heart and brain.
3. In plants, thorns of Bougainvillea
and tendrils of cucurbita represent
homology.
The structural similarities between the
homologous organs indicates that they have a
common ancestory.
Differences in homologous organs are
examples of divergent evolution or adaptive
radiation.

is functional in herbivorous mammals
for digestion of cellulose. In man due
to eating of cooked food it has lost its
function.
Presence of these vestigeal organs provide
evidence that man has (evolved) descended
from simple primates.
Can you recall?
Give examples of embryological
evidences studied in lower classes.
d. Molecular Evidences :
1. Cell is the basic structural and functional
unit of life in all organisms.
2. Similarities in proteins and genetic material
performing a similar function among
diverse organisms gives evidence of a
common ancestry.
3. Basic metabolic activities also occur in a
similar manner in all organisms.
4. ATP is the energy source in all living
organisms.
5.11 Speciation :
The process of formation of a new
species from the per-existing species is called
speciation.
Species is a group of similar organisms
that can interbreed and produce a fertile
offspring in nature. New species are formed by
the following modes.
a. Intraspecific Speciation :
i.

Allopatric speciation : Formation of
a new species due to separation of a
segment of population from the original
population by distanced or a geographical
barrier cutting across the species range.
e.g. creeping glaciers, development of
mountains. Migration of individual also
causes allopatric speciation. The mode of
evolution here is called adaptive radiation

e.g. 14 different species of finches in
Galapagos islands and several marsupial
species in the Australian continent.
ii. Sympatric speciation: Formation of
species within single population without
geographical isolation. These are formed
due to reproductive isolation. e.g. Cichlid
fishes in Lake Victoria. Mutations are
helpful in sympatric speciation.
b. Interspecific Speciation :
Hybridisation :
Two different species on crossing may give
rise to a new species. e.g. Mule is a hybrid
produced by interbreeding between a male
donkey and a female horse. Hinny is offspring
of male horse and female donkey.
Can you recall?
1. What are fossils? why should we study
fossils?
2. How do we find age of fossils ?
3. Where do we find fossils ?
5.12 Geological time scale :
The planet earth with its present biodiversity
was not so when it was born. Study of fossils
tells us that life forms were not the same millions
of years ago (MYA). Geological time scale is
used to understand the sequence of events that
to place on the earth in different ages over
a period of time. It is divided into six major
‘Eras’ Eras ended with major environmental
changes on earth resulting into extinction and
emergence of new species. The eras are further
divided into periods and epochs based on minor
but landmark events in each era. Table 5.15
shows the geological time scale at a glance.
The first life appeared on the earth some
2000 million years ago. It took billions of years
for this process to take place, from protenoids
to first cells the transition is still a mystery.
Once formed the living forms diversified into
various groups. Life began in the sea water and

109

plants were the first living beings to adapt to
terrestrial life. Fishes evolved and diversified.
The lobefin group of fishes too got diversified.
Some developed stout and strong fins and could
go to land and come back to water.
The coelecanth was considered a living
fossils. It was thought that lobefins are extinct,

but the variety of the lobefin fish, called
coelacanth was caught in 1938 in South Africa.
Reptiles evolved from amphibians. They
are the first true land vertebrates. They do not
have to go to water for reproduction. (Hint :
think of amphibian and reptilian eggs). But
about 200 million years ago (mya) some reptiles

moved back to aquatic mode of life and gained
fish like form as seen in Ichthyosaurs. The
giant reptiles like Dinosaurs once dominated
the earth but are now extinct. When was this?
Around 65 million years ago! why it must have
happened? Can we give affirmative reason for
this extinction? At around the same time giant
ferns were present on earth. However, they
also became extinct and got converted to fossil
fuels. How this must have happened?
Decline of giant reptiles marked the
begining of dominance of mammals. These
viviporous organisms were more intelligent.
They could avoid danger. Early mammals
were small shrew like organisms, but this
group diversified. Whales, dolphins, seals
and sea cow live in water, bats are the flying
mammals, Kangaroo rats are fossorial, lemurs
are arboreal. Major physical disturbances led

to phenomenon like the continental drift i.e.
continents moved from their original place.
As a consequence when south America joined
north America, ancestral forms of horse,
hippos, rabbits, etc. native to south america
were dominated by north American animals.
At the same time, marsupial diversified into
different habitats in Australia. These survived
due to lack of competition.
From the fossil records we can trace
complete evolutionary history of horse,
elephant, dog, etc. Human beings are the most
evolved animals on the earth.

5.13 Human Evolution :
Do you know ?
Use your brain power

There is a difference of only 2.5 %
between DNA of chimpanzee and man while
between monkey and man it is 10 %.

Since your earlier school days you have
been solving mysteries/puzzles labelled as
use your brain power. Did you ever wonder
why human brain has such a capacity? Why
and how we evolved along these lines?
What is the extent of similarity between are
humans, chimpanzees and monkeys ?
It has been traced that the human
evolution appeared to have evolved from a
tree dwelling shrew like animal. This process
began in Palaeocene epoch. During this period,
dwindling forests forced arboreal mammals to
adapt to life on land. This descent must have
been the driving force. In the following chart, it
can be seen that we are most closely related to
gibbons, chimpanzees and gorillas.

The major evolutionary trends in transition
from ape to man are considered further. Special
characteristics have been acquired by man in
the course of evolution. Major changes that
took place in evolution of man include increase
in size and complexity of brain and enhanced
intelligence, increase in cranial capacity,
bipedal locomotion, opposable thumb, erect
posture, shortening of forelimbs and lengthening
of hind limbs, development of chin, broadening
of pelvic girdle, development of lumbar
curvature, social and cultural development
(articulated speech, art, development of tools,
etc).

Cranial capacity of human begins increased
over a period of time and large size of frontal
lobe helped in development of high forehead.
Increase in intelligence necessitated
physical development so that body and brain
could be used effectively and productively.
Freedom of forelimbs from locomotory function
and opposable thumb led to better utilization
of hands for holding objects effectively and
development of motor skills etc.

Use your brain power
Even though the cranium of elephant
is larger than that of man, humans are
considered more intelligent than elephant.
Why is it so ?
Some of our ancestors and their
evolutionary history is shown in the table.

Bipedal locomotion, upright posture
coupled with stereoscopic vision helped man to
move around safely on land.

The above table clearly shows the
gradual increase in cranial capacity, shape of
skull and dentition of the ancestral humans till
date.

Evolutionary history of man was traced
with the help of fossil remains found over a
period of time.

not self sufficient. Think of various aspects
for which we depend on other living beings
for our survival.

1. Which are the various parts of plant body?
2. What are the functions of various parts of
plant body?
3. Which plant tissues are involved in
transport of water and minerals?

Curiosity Box :
1. What is hydrogen bond?
2. What are the meanings of specific heat,
heat of vaporization and heat of fusion?
3. What are adhesive and cohesive forces?
Water molecules have good adhesive and
cohesive forces of attraction. Due to high
surface tension and high adhesive and cohesive
force, it can easily rise in the capillaries. It is
therefore, a significant molecule that connects
physical world with biological processes.

You know that we need a water pump
to lift water at top of the building. but, how
does plants lift the water from soil upto
canopy without any pump?
Plant obtains variety of substances like
water, minerals, nutrients, food and gases
like O2 and CO2, from its surroundings.
Productivity in plants is mainly affected by the
non-availibility of water.
Water is considered as ‘elixir of life’.
Water constitutes almost 90 to 95% of most
plant cells and tissues. Water helps the cells
to maintain turgidity and shape. It shows
following properties due to which it has great
biological importance.

6.2 Water absorbing organ:
Root :
Root is the main organ of water and
mineral absorption. In terestrial plants, plants
absorb water in the form of liquid from the soil
however, epiphytic plants like orchids absorb
water vapours from air with the help of epiphytic
roots having special tissue called velamen.
Typical root is divisible into four different
regions. In the zone of absorption, epidermal
cells (epiblema cells) form unicellular hair like
extensions called root hairs.

6.1 Properties of water:
It is in the liquid form at room temperature
and is the best solvent for most of the solutes.
It is inert inorganic compound with neutral pH
when in pure form. Due to this, water is best
transporting medium for dissolved minerals
and food molecules. It is best aqueous medium
for all biochemical reactions occurring in
the cells. It is an essential raw material for
photosynthesis. Water has high specific heat,
high heat of vaporization and high heat of
fusion. Due to this, it acts as thermal buffer.
These various properties are due to hydrogen
bonds between the water molecules.

Structure of root hair :
Root hair is cytoplasmic extension
(prolongation) of epiblema cell. Each root hair
may be approximately 1 to 10mm long and
tube like structure. It is colourless, unbranched,
short-lived (ephemeral) and very delicate. It
has a large central vacuole surrounded by thin
film of cytoplasm, plasma membrane and thin
cell wall, which is two layered. Outer layer is
composed of pectin and inner layer is made up
of cellulose. Cell wall is freely permeable but
plasma membrane is selectively permeable.
6.3 Water available to roots for absorption:
Plants absorb water from the rhizosphere
(the microenvironment surrounding the root).
Water present in the soil occurs as gravitational
(free) water, hygroscopic water, combined
water and capillary water. Water percolates
deep, due to the gravity, in the soil, is called
‘gravitational water’. This is not available
to plants for absorption. Fine soil particles
imbibe/ adsorb water and hold it. This is called
‘hygroscopic water’. Roots cannot absorb it.
Water present in the form of hydrated oxides
of silicon, aluminum, etc., is called ‘combined
water’. It is also not available to plants for
absorption. Some amount of water is held in
pores present between the neighbouring soil
particles, due to capillarity. This is called
capillary water that is avilable for absorption.
6.4 Absorption of water by roots from soil:
Root hair absorbs water by employing three
physical processes that occur sequentially- viz.
imbibition, diffusion and osmosis.

a. Imbibition:
Imbibition is swelling up of hydrophillic
colloids due to adsorption of water. Substance
that adsorbs water / liquid, is called as imbibant
and water/ liquid, that gets imbibed is called
as imbibate. The root hair cell wall is made
up of pectic compounds and cellulose which
are hydrophillic colloids. During Imbibition,
water molecules get tightly adsorbed without
the formation of solution. Imbibition continues
till the equilibrium is reached. In other words,
water moves along the concentration gradient.
Imbibition is significant in soaking of
seeds, swelling up of dried raisins, kneading of
flour etc.

Why do the wooden doors become
very hard to close and open in rainy season?
b. Diffusion: Diffusion means to disperse.
Diffusion can be defined as the movement of
ions/ atoms/ molecules of a substance from the
region of their higher concentration to the region
of their lower concentration. The movement
is due to the kinetic energy of the molecules.
Diffusion continues till an equilibrium is
reached. Thus, water passes into the cell by
diffusion through a freely permeable cell wall.
Water is now at the interface of cell wall and
plasma membrane.
Diffusion results in the diffusion pressure
(D. P.) which is directly proportional to the
number of diffusing particles. Diffusion
pressure of pure solvent (pure water) is always

changes in raisins since the time you put them in water till they become fully swollen i.e.

B. Take 10 ml of pure water and add 5 gms of either sugar or salt to it. Let it dissolve and then
put the same turgid raisins in it and observe the changes in raisins. What changes did occur
in raisins and why? Discuss your observations with your teachers.

more than the diffusion pressure of solvent
in a solution. The difference in the diffusion
pressures of pure solvent and the solvent in a
solution is called Diffusion Pressure Deficit
(DPD) or Suction Pressure (SP). The term
was coined by B.S. Meyer (1938). Now a
days, term water potential is used for DPD. In
colloquial language, the term DPD is actually
the thirst of a cell with which it absorbs water
from the surroundings. Water arround cell
wall has more diffusion pressure than cell
sap. Due to this, water moves in the cell by
diffusion. Diffusion is significant in plants in
the absorption of water, minerals, conduction
of water against the gravity, exchange of gases
and transport and distribution of food.

1. When you burn an incense stick in one
corner of room, its fragrance spreads all
over the room in a short time. How does
it happen?
2. How does the water come out through
the surface of porous earthen pot?

c. Osmosis : It is a process by which water enters
into the cytoplasm of the root hair cell. Osmosis
is a special type of diffusion of solvent through
a semipermeable membrane. The cytoplasm
of root hair cell contains minerals, sugars,
etc. In other words, solution inside the cell is
more concentrated (stronger) than outside the
cell (weaker). Therefore, solvent from weaker
solution enters into cytoplasm (i.e. to stronger
solution) of cell through a semipermiable
plasma membrane. This migration of solvent is
called Osmosis.
Thus, water at the interface of cell wall and
plasma membrane, enters into the cytoplasm of
the root hair cell due to osmosis.
With respect to the concentration and
osmotic migration, three types of solutions are
recognized viz,
i. Hypotonic (weak solution or strong
solvent) having low osmotic concentration.
ii. Hypertonic (strong solution or weak
solvent) having high osmotic concentration.
iii. Isotonic having such a concentration of
solution where there is neither gain nor
loss of water in an osmotic system. In other
words, concentration outside and inside the
cell is same.
Osmosis is of two types viz, Exo-osmosis
and Endo-osmosis.
Exo-osmosis : It is the migration of solvent
from the cell outside. It causes flaccidity of cell.
Endo-osmosis : It is the migration of the
solvent into the cell. It causes turgidity of
cell i.e. cytoplasm becomes turgid. Turgidity
increases the turgor pressure (T. P.) of the cell.
T. P. is the pressure exerted by turgid cell sap on
to the cell membrane and cell wall. In a fully
turgid cell, DPD is zero. Cell wall being thick
and rigid, exerts a counter pressure on the cell
sap. This is called Wall pressure (W. P.). In a
fully turgid cell, T. P. = W. P. but operating in
opposite direction.
Osmotic pressure (O. P.) : The pressure
exerted due to osmosis is osmotic pressure.

121

Osmotic pressure is a pressure of the solution,
which is required in opposite direction, so as to
stop the entry of solvent molecules into the cell.
More simply, osmotic pressure of a solution
is equivalant to the pressure which must be
exerted upon it to prevent flow of solvent across
a semipermeable membrane.
Therefore,

D. P. D. = O. P. - T. P.
( T. P. = W. P.)
∴ D. P. D. = O. P. - W. P.
In a flaccid cell, T. P. is zero ∴ DPD = OP
In a turgid cell, DPD is zero ∴ TP = OP

6.5 Water Potential (ψ):
According
to
the
principle
of
thermodynamics, every component of a system
is having a definite amount of free energy
which is used to do work. Osmotic movement
of water is on the basis of free energy. Free
energy per molecule in a chemical system, is
called its chemical potential.
Chemical potential of water is called water
potential. It is represented by Greek letter psi
(ψ). Water potential of protoplasm is equal but
opposite in sign to DPD It has negative value.
The unit of measurement is in bars/ pascals/
atmospheres.
Water potential of pure water is always
zero. Addition of any solute in it, decreases its
psi (ψ) value. Therefore, it has negative value.

∴

Do you know ?
Improtance of T. P. : It keeps cells and
organelles stretched; provides support to
the non-woody tissues; essential for cell
enlargement during growth; maintains shape
of cell and facilitates opening and closing of
stoma.
Improtance of Osmosis : It is responsible
for absorption of water into root; maintains
turgidity of cell; facilitates cell to cell
movement of water; offers resistance to
drought, frost, etc; also helps in the drooping
of leaflets and leaves in vicinity of “touch me
not” plant.

D. P. D. is now termed as water potential.
O. P. is now termed as osmotic potential.
T. P. is now termed as pressure potential. It
has always positive value.
Water always flows from less negative
potential to more negative water potential
(i.e. from high water potential area to low
water potential area). Difference between
water potential of the adjacent cells decides
movement of water through plasmodesmata
across the cells.

Facilitated diffusion : The passive absorption
of solutes when mediated by a carrier, is
called Facilitated diffusion. Particles that
are lipid soluble can easily diffuse through
lipoproteinous cell membrane. The diffusion
of hydrophilic solutes has to be facilitated
because their diffusion across the membrane
is difficult. Membrane proteins provide
such sites for facilitated diffusion. These
proteins are aquaporins and ion- channels.
These proteins help move substances across
membranes without the expenditure of energy.
Concentration gradient must be present for the
molecules to be diffused through facilitated
diffusion.

Factors affecting water absorption:
i. Presence of capillary water is essential.
ii. Rate of water absorption is maximum at
soil temperature between 200 to 300C.
iii. High concentration of solutes in soil water
reduced the rate of absorption of water.
iv. Poorly aerated soil shows poor absorption
rate.
v. Increased transpiration accelarates the rate
of absorption of water in the irrigated soil.
6.6 Plasmolysis:
Exo-osmosis in a living cell when placed
in hypertonic solution, is called plasmolysis.
During plasmolysis, protoplast of cell shrinks
and recedes from cell wall. Thus, cell becomes

122

flaccid. In a plasmolysed cell, a gap is
developed between cell wall and the protoplast.
This gap is filled up by outer solution.
In a plasmolysed cell, T. P. is always zero.
When such cell is placed in hypotonic solution,
endo-osmosis occur, making cell turgid. This
is called deplasmolysis. In a fully turgid cell
T. P. = O. P. hence, DPD is always zero.
6.7 Path of water across the root (i.e. from
epiblema upto xylem in the stelar region) :
Water is absorped by root hair cell
through imbibition
diffusion
osmosis,
sequentially. Consequently the cell becomes
turgid. Its turgar pressure increases, but its DPD
value decreases. However, the immidiately
adjacent cortical cell inner to it, has more DPD
value, because its O. P. is more. Therefore,
cortical cell will suck water from the turgid root
hair cell. It then becomes turgid. The flaccid
root hair cell now absorbs water from soil.
Water from the turgid cortical cell is sucked
by inner cortical cell and the process goes on.
Thus, a gradient of suction pressure (DPD) is
devloped from cells of epiblema to the cortex
of the root. Consequently water moves rapidly
across the root through loosely arranged
living cells of cortex, followed by passage
cells of endodermis and finally into the cell of
pericycle. Protoxylem is in the close proximity
with pericycle.
Endodermis

Pericycle

Absorption of water being a continous
process, a sort of hydrostatic pressure is
developed in living cells of root. This is called
root pressure. It is due to root pressure, water
from pericycle is not only forced into the xylem,
but also conducted upwards against the gravity.
Pathway of water across the root essentially
occurs in two ways viz, apoplast and symplast.

The apoplastic (non-living) pathway
provides a route toward the vascular stele
through free spaces and cell walls of the
epidermis and cortex. An additional apoplastic
route that allows direct access to the
xylem and phloem is along the margins of
secondary roots. Secondary roots develop
from the pericycle, a cell layer just inside the
endodermis. The endodermis is characterized
by the Casparian strip, a suberized layer that
forces all to move in the symplast in order to
enter the vascular system. Since secondary
roots grow through the endodermis, a direct
pathway to the xylem and phloem is available
that bypasses the Casparian strip and allows
to enter the vascular system without moving
into the symplast (living tissue).

When some amount of water passes
across the root through the cell wall and the
intercellular spaces of cortical cells of root, it
is then called apoplast pathway. This pathway
occurs up to endodermis.

Cortex

Symplast

When water passes across from one living
cell to other living cell through plasmodesmata,
then it is called symplast pathway. It is also
called transmembrane pathway.
6.8 Mechanism of absorption of water :
Mainly, there are two ways/ modes of
absorption of water viz, passive absorption and
active absorption.
123

a. Passive absorption :
It is the main way of absorbing water
through the roots and not by the roots from soil
into the plant. The driving force is transpiration
pull and it thus proceeds through DPD gradient.
There is no expenditure of energy (ATP) as
water moves in accordance to the concentration
gradient. Hence, it is passive absorption. About
98% of the total water absorbed in plants, occur
passively. Passive absorption occurs during
day time when transpiration is in progress. It
stops at night when transpiration stops.
Rapid transpiration creates a tension in the
xylem vessel due to negative water potential.
This tension is transmitted to xylem in the
roots. Consequently water is pulled upwards
passively.
During passive absorption, no ATP is
utilized. Obviously, the rate of respiration is not
affected. In plants, water is mainly absorbed
passively.
b. Active absorption :
Here, water is absorbed due to activity
of roots. Root cells play active role in the
absorption of water. The driving force is the root
pressure developed, in the living cells of root.
Active absorption occurs usually at night when
transpiration stops due to closure of stomata. As
water absorption is against the DPD gradient,
there is expenditure of ATP (energy) generated
through the respiratory activity of cells.
Active absorption may be of two kinds
viz, osmotic and non-osmotic :
1. Osmotic absorption : Atkins and Priestly
(1922) proposed that water is absorbed from soil
into xylem of the root according to the osmotic
gradient. To create osmotic conditions, there is
an expenditure of energy. But such absorption
does not directly require an expenditure of
energy.
A gradient of DPD develops from cell of
epiblema to pericycle due to activity of living
cells of root. As the process is continuous,

a hydrostatic pressure, called root pressure,
is developed in root cells. This root pressure
forces water from pericycle to xylem and then
upwards to the stem.
2. Non-osmotic absorption : Kramer and
Thimann (1959) proposed this theory.
Sometimes, water is absorbed from soil against
the concentration gradiant. Such absorption
requires an expenditure of energy released
during respiration, directly. Poor supply of
oxygen retards water absorption. Moreover
low temperature retards water uptake because
of decrease in the rate of respiration. Use of
metabolic inhibitors also retards the rate of
respiration and thus the water uptake.
6.9 Translocation of water:
The transport of water with dissolved
minerals from root to other aerial parts like
stem and leaves, against the gravity, is called
translocation or ascent of sap.
Translocation of water occurs through
the lumen of conducting elements of xylemtracheids and vessels, in all vascular plants.
Ringing experiment has proved that xylem is
the path of ascent of sap.
Several mechanisms/ theories have
been put forth to explain the mechanism of
translocation of water. The theories includevital force theory, relay pump theory, physical
force theory, root pressure theory, etc. We shall
consider following three theories :
a. Root Pressure Theory (Vital Theory) :
According to this theory, the activity
of living cells of root is responsible for
translocation of water. J. Pristley proposed this
theory. When a stem of potted plant is cut few
inches above the soil by a sharp knife, xylem
sap is seen flowing out/ oozing out through the
cut end. This exudation at the cut end of stem is
a good proof for the existence of root pressure.
As water absorption by roots is constant and
continous process, a hydrostatic pressure is
developed in the living cells of cortex of root.

124

This is termed as root pressure by S. Hales. It is
due to root pressure water along with dissolved
minerals is not only forced into xylem but it is
also conducted upwards against the gravity.
Root pressure seems to be largely an
osmotic phenomenon and its development is an
active process. The value of root pressure is +1
to +2 bars which is enough to pump water to
a height of 10 to 20 meters. The factors like
oxygen, moisture, temperature of soil, salt
contents, etc. influence the root pressure.

b. Capillarity theory (physical force theory):
According to this theory, physical forces
and dead cells are responsible for ascent of sap.
This theory was put forth by Bohem in
(1863). Wick dipped in an oil lamp, shows
capillarity due to which oil is raised upwards.
The conduction of water in a straw dipped in
water, is raised to a certain height because of
capillarity. The height to which water is raised
depends on the diameter of the straw.
Capilarity is because of surface tension,
and forces of cohesion (attraction between like
molecules) and adhesion (attraction between
unlike molecules). Xylem vessel/ tracheid with
its lumen is comparable with straw. Water
column exist because of combined cohesive
and adhesive forces of water and xylem wall,
due to capillarity. It is because of capillarity
water is raised or conducted upwards against
the gravity, to few centimeters only.
Objections/ Limitations of capillarity theory:
Few important objections are :

Fig. 6.4 : Experiment to demonstrate root
pressure
Objections/ limitations of root pressure
theory:
Although, ascent of sap takes place due
to root pressure, there are certain objections
raised, such as i. It is not applicable to plants taller than 20
meters.
ii. Ascent of sap can also occur even in the
absence of root system.
iii. Root pressure value is almost nearly zero in
taller gymnosperm trees.
iv. In actively transpiring plants, no root
pressure is developed.
v. Xylem sap under normal condition is under
tension i.e. it shows negative hydrostatic
pressure or high osmotic pressure.
To sum up therefore, root pressure is not
the sole mechanism explaining the ascent of
sap in all plants of varying heights..

i. Capillary tube (xylem) must be continously
and completely hollow from one end to the
other end but tracheids in the xylem show
closed end-walls.
ii. The lower end of capillary tube i.e. xylem
must be in direct contact with soil water.
However, there exists a barrier of root
cortex between xylem and soil water.
iii. Narrower the capillary tube, greater is the
height to which water column is raised.
Thus, taller trees should show xylem
vessels with very narrow bore (diameter).
However, in nature the tall trees show
xylem vessels having wider bore.
Hence, to sum up capillarity can not be the
sole mechanism to explain ascent of sap in all
the plants of varying heights.
c. Cohesion- tension theory (Transpiration
pull theory) :
This is presently widely accepted theory
explaining ascent of sap in plants. It was put

125

forth by Dixon and Joly (1894). This theory is
based on two principles.
Cohesion and adhesion, and transpiration
pull :
A strong force of attraction between water
molecules, is called cohesive force. While
a strong force of attraction between water
molecules and lignified wall of lumen of xylem
vessel, is called adhesive force.
Due to combined cohesive and adhesive
forces a continous water column is developed
(formed) in the xylem right from root upto the
tip of the topmost leaf in the plant.
Transpiration pull : The transpiration pull
developed in the leaf vessel is transmitted down
to root and thus accounts for the ascent of sap.
Excess water is lost in the form of vapour,
mainly through the stomata found on leaf.
This water loss increases D. P. D. of mesophyll
cells. These cells withdraw water ultimately
from xylem in the leaf. In otherwords, due to
continous transpiration, a gradient of suction
pressure (i.e. D. P. D.) is developed right from
guard cells up to the xylem in the leaf. This
will create a tension (called negative pull or
transpiration pull) in the xylem. Consequently,
water column is pulled out of xylem. Thus,
water is pulled upwards passively against the
gravity leading to the ascent of sap.
Objections/ Limitations of transpiration pull
theory:
i. For transpiration pull to operate, water
column should be unbroken and continous.
However, due to temperature fluctuations
during day and night, gas bubbles may enter
in water column breaking the continuity.
ii. This mechanism assumes that tracheids are
more efficient than the vessels, as their end
walls support water column.
However, vessels are more evolved
than tracheids and are more efficient.

iii. If plant is smeared with vaseline in order to
stop transpiration, even then ascent of sap
occurs.
iv. Ascent of sap also occurs in deciduous
plants that have shed all of their leaves.
These observations point to the fact that
besides physical forces, activity of living cells
seems to be necessary for lifting the water
column up.
6.10 Transport of mineral ions :
Soil serves as main source for minerals.
Minerals constitute most commonly occuring
solid, crystalline inorganic materials obtained
from earth’s crust. Minerals play an important
role in the day to day life of plant. Minerals are
absorbed by plants in the ionic (disolved) form,
mainly through roots and then transported.
Do you know ?
•

•

Minerals that play important role in
the day to day life, are called essential
elements. About 36 to 40 elements are
incorporated in the plant’s life.
Some minerals like C, H, O, P, N, S, Mg
required in large quantity, are called
macro elements. While minerals like Cu,
Co, Mn, B, Zn required in small quantity,
are called micro elements.

The analysis of plant ash demonstrates
that minerals are absorbed by plants from soil
and surroundings. Absorption of minerals is
independent of that of water.
Absorbed mineral ions are pulled in
upward direction along with xylem sap because
of transpiration pull. This could be understood
when the ascending sap is analysed. Mineral
ions are needed in the areas of the plant viz.
apical, lateral, young leaves, developing
flowers, fruits, seeds and storage organs.
Hence, from the source (root), these are pulled
and transported ascendingly through the sap
and gets unloaded by fine veins through the

126

process of diffusion in the vicinity of cells.
Cells uptake them actively.

food from one part to the other part, is called
translocation of food.

Soil would not be the only source for mineral
uptake. Mineral ions can be remobilized within
the parts of the plant. Older parts (like leaves in
deciduous plants) export their ions to younger
leaves before the fall. Most readily mobilized
ions are like phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen
and potassium but the ions from structural
components like calcium is not remobilized.

Path of translocation : Food is to be
translocated to longer distances in higher
plants. Hence plants must have adequate
channels for the transport of food. Sieve tubes
and vessels are structurally ideally suited
for longitudinal (vertical) translocation. The
ringing experiment, structure and distribution
of phloem, chemical analysis of phloem sap
and use of isotope 14C, clearly point out that the
phloem tissue is primarily responsible for flow
of food in longitudinal downward direction.
The horizontal (lateral) translocation occurs
from phloem to pith or phloem to cortex via
medullary rays in the stem.
Food is always translocated in the form of
sucrose (soluble form) and always along the
concentration gradient from source to sink. The
transport of food occurs in vertical and lateral
direction.

Analysis of xylem exudate also shows
that some nitrogen travels as inorganic ions
whereas much of it is carried in the organic
form like amino acids and related compounds.
Small amount of inorganic molecules of
phosphorus and sulphur are also carried. It was
a belief earlier that xylem transports inorganic
and phloem transports organic molecules.
However, it is not correct because some
exchange of materials also occurs between
xylem and phloem.

Vertical translocation : In vertical
(longitudinal) transport, food is translocated
in downward direction from leaves (source) to
stem and root (sink). It also occurs in upward
direction during germination of seed, bulbils,
corm, etc. Upward translocation also occurs
from leaves to growing point of stem, to
developing flowers and fruits situated near the
ends of the branches of stem.

active absorption of minerals in plants.

6.11 Transport of food :
All the plant parts require continous supply
of food for nutrition and developement. In
higher plants, there is a great differentiation and
division of labour. Chloroplasts are confined to
green cells of leaves where food is synthesized.
The non-green parts like root and stem must
received food from leaves. The part where food
is synthesized is called source and while part
where it is utilized, is called sink. Food has to
travel from source to sink. This movement of

Lateral translocation : It occurs in the root and
stem. When food is translocated from phloem
to pith, it is called radial translocation and
from phloem to cortex, it is called tangential
translocation.
The transport of food through phloem is
bidirectional. Phloem sap contains mainly
water and food in the form of sucrose. But
sugars, amino acids and hormones are also
transported through phloem.
Mechanism of sugar transport through
phloem :
Several mechanisms/ theories like
diffusion, activated diffusion, protoplasmic
streaming, electro-osmosis, pressure-flow, etc.
are put forth. The most convincing theory is
Munch’s pressure flow theory or mass flow
hypothesis.
Ernst Munch proposed that photosynthetic
cell synthesizes glucose. Hence, its osmotic
concentration increases. Due to endo-osmosis
water from surrounding cells and xylem,
is absorbed. The cell becomes turgid. Due
to increase in turgor pressure, sugar from
photosynthetic cell is forced ultimately into the
sieve tube of the vein. This is called loading of
Vein.
At the sink end, root cell utilizes sugar
and also polymerizes excess sugar into the
starch. Its osmotic concentration is lowered.
Exo-osmosis occurs. Water in the root cell is
lost to surrounding cells, thereby decreasing
the turgidity of cell. Turgor pressure is lowered.
Hence, a turgor pressure gradient is developed
from sieve tube in the leaf to the root cell.
Consequently, food is translocated along the
concentration gradient, passively. This is Vein
unloading. At the sink end sugar is used and
excess water exudes into the xylem.
Main objection to this theory is that this
mechanism does not explain bidirectional
transport of food. More over, according to
Munch, pressure flow is purely a physical
process.

6.12 Transpiration :
Plants absorb water constantly and
continously. Hardly 5% of the total water
absorbed by roots that is utilised for cell
expansion and plant growth. Remaining 95%
water becomes surplus which is then lost into
the atmosphere, through its aerial parts. Hardly
1% of surplus water is lost in the form of liquid
and 99% of surplus water, is lost in the form of
vapour. The loss of water in the form of liquid
is called guttation. It occurs through special
structures called water stomata or hydathodes.
The loss of water in the form of vapour is called
transpiration that occurs through leaves, stem,
flowers and fruits. Most of the transpiration
occurs through the leaves (called foliar
transpiration). The actual water loss during
transpiration occurs through three main sites
- cuticle, stomata and lenticels. Accordingly,
three types of transpiration are recognized viz.
cuticular, stomatal and lenticular.
Water evaporates
from the leaves
Veins carry water
into the leaves

Water is drawn up
the stem to the leaves

Roots take up water
from the soil

Fig. 6.6 : Transpiration
i. Cuticular transpiration:
Cuticle is a layer of waxy substance- cutin,
present on outer surface of epidermal cells of
leaves and stem. Cuticular transpiration occurs
by simple diffusion and contributes 8-10% of
the total transpiration. Cuticular transpiration

128

occurs throughout the day and its rate is
inversely proportional to thickness of cuticle.
ii. Lenticular transpiration:
Lenticels are small raised structures
composed of loosely arranged complementary
cells. Each lenticel is a porous tissue consisting
of cells with large intercellular spaces in
the periderm of the secondarily thickened
organs and the bark of woody stems and roots
of dicotyledonous flowering plants. Lenticels
are present in bark of old stem and pericarp
of woody fruits but are absent in leaves.
Lenticular transpiration contributes only
about 0.1-1.0% of total transpiration. Rate of

The number of stomata per unit area of
leaf, is called stomatal frequency.
The correlation between the number of
stomata and number of epidermal cells
per unit area, is called stomatal index (I).

6.13 Structure of stomatal apparatus :
Typical stomatal apparatus consists of two
guard cells, stoma and accessory cells.

lenticular transpiration is very slow. It also
occurs throughout the day.
iii. Stomatal transpiration:
Stomata are minute apertures formed of
two guard cells and accessory cells. They are
located in the epidermis of young stem and
leaves. Leaves generally show more number
of stomata on the lower surface. Depending
upon distribution of stomata on leaves, leaves
are categorized into three types namely
epistomatic- on upper epidermis (Hydrophytese.g. Lotus), hypostomatic- on lower epidermis
(Xerophytes- e.g. Nerium) and amphistomaticon both surfaces (Mesophytes- e.g. Grass).
Stomatal transpiration occurs only during
daytime. (Exception: Desert plants).

Chloroplast

Fig. 6.8 (b) : Open and closed stoma
Stomata are minute, elliptical pores
bounded by two kidney/ dumbbell shaped
guard cells. Guard cell is a type of epidermal
tissue which may be called as modified,
epidermal parenchyma cell. They are kidneyshaped in dicotyledons and dumbbell-shaped
in grasses.

90 to 93% of total transpiration occurs
through stomata and that too during day time
only.

B. Dumbbell shaped

Fig. 6.9 : Types of guard cells

In Cyperus, both kidney- and dumbbellshaped guard cells are present.
Guard cells are living, nucleated cells with
unevenly thick walls. Inner wall (wall facing
stoma) of guard cells is thick and inelastic, and
its lateral wall is thin and elastic. Guard cells
contain few chloroplasts which are capable of
poor photosynthesis. Guard cells have ability to
change their size and form due to which stoma
opens (widens) or closes (narrows).
Stoma is an elliptical pore formed due
to specific arrangement of guard cells. It is
through the stoma, excess water is lost in the
form of vapour.
Accessory cells : These are specialized
epidermal cells surrounding the guard cells.
Their number is variable and are the reservoirs
of K+ ions. These are also called subsidiary
cells.
Opening and Closing of Stoma :
Opening and closing of stoma is controlled
by turgor of guard cells. During day time,
guard cells become turgid due to endosmosis.
Thus turgor pressure is exerted on the thin
walls of guard cells. Being elastic and thin,
lateral walls are stretched out. Due to kidney
or dumb-bell like shape, inner thick walls are
pulled apart to open (widen) the stoma. During
night time, guard cells become flaccid due to
exosmosis. Flaccidity closes the stoma almost
completely. Endosmosis and exosmosis occur
due to diurnal changes in osmotic potential of
guard cells. Different theories are proposed to
explain diurnal changes in osmotic potential.
According
to
starch-sugar interconversion theory (Steward 1964), during day
time, enzyme phosphorylase converts startch
to sugar, thus increasing osmotic potential of
guard cells cosing entry of water there by gaurd
cells are stretched and stoma widens. The
reverse reaction occures at night brining about
the closure of stoma.
Phosphorylase (Day)
Starch
(Stoma opens)

Sugar
Night

(Stoma closes)

According to theory of proton transport
(Levitt-1974), stomatal movement occurs due
to transport of protons H+ and K+ ions. During
daytime, starch is converted into malic acid.
Malic acid dissociates to form Malate and
protons. Protons are transported to subsidiary
cells and K+ ions are imported from them.
Potassium malate is formed that increases
osmolarity and causes endosmosis. Uptake of
K+ ions is always accompanied with Cl¯ ions.
At night, uptake of K+and Cl- ions is
prevented by abscissic acid, changing the
permeability of guard cells. Due to this guard
cells become hypotonic and thereby become
flaccid.
Significance of Transpiration :
Advantages:
i. It removes excess of water.
ii. It helps in the passive absorption of water
and minerals from soil.
iii. It helps in the ascent of sap.
iv. As stomata are open, gaseous exchange
required for photosynthesis and respiration,
is facilitated.
v. It maintains turgor of the cells.
vi. Transpiration helps in reducing the
temperature of leaf and in imparting
cooling effect.
Disadvantages:
Excessive transpiration leads to wilting
and injury in the plant. It may also lead to the
death of the plant.
Transpiration is ‘A necessary evil’ :
For stomatal transpiration to occur, stoma
must remain open, during day time. When
stomata are open then only the gaseous exhange
needed for respiration and photosynthesis, will
take place. If stomatal transpiration stops, it will
directly affect productivity of plant through the
loss of photosynthetic and respiratory activity.
Hence for productivity, stomata must remain
open. Consequently transpiration can not be
avoided. Hence, Curtis (1926) regarded
transpiration as ‘a necessary evil’.

Plant Growth and Mineral Nutrition
Do you know ?

Can you recall?

Apical meristem : In vascular plants, growth
is restricted to the apices of root and shoot. It
is responsible for growth in length/ height and
the differentiation or cell types. It contributes
to the primary growth.
Intercalary meristem : It is located at the
node or at the base of internode of stem. It
is primarily responsible for increasing length
of internodes and also for formation of leaf
primordia and lateral buds.
Lateral meristem : It is located laterally along
the axis of dicotyledons and gymnosperms. It
is located as strip in the vascular bundles of
stem of dicots. It is called vascular cambium.
It is responsible for increase in the girth of the
stem due to addition of secondary vascular
tissues.

1. Do you think that the growth is property of
living beings only?
2. Is there any difference between plant
growth and animal growth?

7.1 Plant growth :
Growth is one of the characteristic features
of living organisms. Growth as a phenomenon
has two aspects viz. quantitative and
qualitative. Quantitative aspect speaks for an
increase in the length, breadth, size, volume,
body mass or dry weight and number of cells.
Growth as a quantitative change is a final end
product of successive metabolism.
Qualitative aspect talks about the change
in the nature of growth where development
is an ordered change or progress while
differentiation leads to higher and more
complex state. Growth thus can be defined as
permanent, irreversible increase in the bulk of
an organism, accompanied by the change of
form.
In multicellular (vascular) plants, growth
is indeterminate and occurs throughout
the life indefinitely. It is restricted to some
specific region called meristems which are
the regions where new cells are constantly and
continuously produced. Meristems are of three
types based on location viz. Apical, Intercalary
and Lateral.
Do you know ?
Root and stem show indefinite or
indeterminate growth. However, in organs
like leaves, flowers and fruits, growth is
determinate. i.e. they grow up to certain
genetically destined size. In unicellular
plants, growth is uniform and determinate.

7.2 Phases of growth :
The cells in the meristem divide, enlarge
and get differentiated. Corresponding to these
three stages, there are three phases of growth :
A. Phase of cell division/ formation : Cells
of meristem are thin walled, non-vacuolated
having prominent nucleus and granular
cytoplasm. Meristematic cell undergoes
mitotic division to form two new cells. One
cell remains meristematic and the other cell
undergoes enlargement and differentiation. In
this phase, rate of growth occurs at a slower
pace (Lag phase).
B. Phase of cell enlargement/ elongation :
The newly formed cell becomes
vacuolated, osmotically active and turgid due
to absorption of water. The turgidity results in
the enlargement of cell - both lengthwise and
breadthwise. In this phase new wall materials
and other materials are synthesized to cope
up with the enlargement. The growth rate
in this phase occurs at an accelerated pace
(exponential or Log phase).

134

C. Phase of Cell maturation/ differentiation :
The enlarged cell now becomes specialized
to perform specific fuction and attains maturity
- both morphological and physiological. In this
phase, rate of growth slows down and comes to
a steady state (stationary phase).

the end (B)
7.3 Conditions for Growth :
The
different
environmental
and
physiological conditions necessary for the
growth include - Water, supply of nutrients,

temperature, oxygen, Carbon/ Nitrogen ratio,
gravitational force, light and growth hormones.
The chief conditions are explained below :
Water is the essential component of
protoplasm and maintains turgidity of the cell.
It acts as aqueous medium for biochemical
reactions. Microelements and Macroelements
are nutrients required for the proper growth
of the plant. Optimum Temperature ranges
between 25-350C. Oxygen is essential for
respiration and the release of energy. Light is
very much essential for germination of seed and
photosynthesis. Gravitational force decides
the direction of growth of the shoot and root.
7.4 Growth Rate and types of growth :
Growth rate :
It is the increased growth per unit time. It
is also called efficiency index. Rate of growth
can be measured by an increase in the size and
area of different plant organs like leaf, flower
and fruits.
The ratio of change in the cell number (dn)
over the time interval (dt) is called Absolute
growth rate (AGR). Alternatively, it is the
measurement and comparison of total growth
per unit time.

Growth in plants can be measured in terms of....
1. Increase in the number of cells produced - e.g. single maize root apical mesistem can give rise
to more than 17,500 new cells/Hour.
2. Increase in surface area of the leaf - e.g. growth of dorsiventral leaf.
3. Increase in length - e.g. growth of pollen tube.
4. Increase in volume of a fruit - e.g. In watermelon flower, ovary after fertilization increases in
its size/ volume by upto 3,50,000 times.
5. Increase in girth of shoot.
6. Increase in dry weight of organ.
Various methods for the measurement of linear growth of stem and radicle are as follows:
1. Direct method : It can easily be measured with the help of ordinary measuring scale. It is a
simple method.
2. Horizontal microscope : It is used to measure growth in fields.
3. Auxanometer : This equipment is used for precise measurement of linear growth of shoot.
There are two types of an auxanometers viz, a) Arc auxanometer b) Pfeffer’s auxanometer
4. Crescograph : It records primary growth very accurately. It magnifies growth upto 10,000
times giving information of growth per second. It is developed by sir J. C. Bose.

135

initially but later on there is a rapid growth
at exponential rate. Geometric growth can be
expressed mathematically by an equation.

Types of growth :
There are two types of growth viz,
arithmetic growth and geometric growth.
a. Arithmetic growth : Here, rate of the
growth is constant and an increase in the
growth occurs in arithmetic progression. i.e. 2,
4, 6, 8 cms etc.In this type of growth, the rate of
growth is constant.
After mitosis one of the daughter cell
continues to divide and the other cell takes
part in the differentiation and maturation.
e.g. elongation of root at a constant rate, best
explains arithmetic growth. Linear curve is
obtained when growth rate is plotted against
the time. Arithmetic growth is expressed
mathematically by an equation,
It is expressed as,
Lt = Lo + rt
Where
Lt = Length at time ‘t’
Lo = Length at time ‘Zero’
r = Growth rate
t = Time of growth
When graph of length (L) is plotted against
the time (t), a linear curve is obtained as
indicated in the diagram.
b. Geometric growth :
Cell divides mitotically into two. Here,
both the daughter cells continue to divide and
redivide repeatedly. Such growth is called
geometric growth. Here, growth rate is slow

AGR = dt
The AGR, when divided by total number of
cells present in the medium, gives Relative
growth ratio (RGR). Alternatively, RGR refers
to the growth of a particular system per unit
time, expressed on a common basis or it is the
ratio of growth in the given time/ initial growth.

We can also observe quantitative
comparison between the growth of living
system in two ways.
Measurement and comparisons of total
growth per unit time is called the Absolute
growth rate(AGR) whereas the growth of
the given system per unit time expressed on
a common basis per unit initial parameter is
called the Relative growth rate(RGR).

In the above example, two leaves ‘A’
and ‘B’ are of different sizes but show same
absolute increase in area in a given time. Both
leaves grow and increase their area by 5cm2
to produce ‘A’ and ‘B’ leaves. ‘A’ leaf of 5cm2
in size grows 5cm2/ day then its RGR would
be 100%. If the leaf is 50cm2 in size and the
growth rate/day is 5cm2 then its RGR would
become 10%.
7.5 Growth curve :
It is a graphic representation of the total
growth against time. There are three types of
curves viz, Linear, Exponential and Sigmoid.
Arithmetic growth curve is linear while
Geometric growth curve is exponential.
Corresponding to three distinct phases
of growth, growth rates differ. In Lag phase,
growth rate is slow. In Exponential (Log)
phase, growth rate is faster and reaches its
maximum. In Stationary phase, growth rate
gradually slows down. When a graph of rate of
growth against time is plotted for three phases
of growth, a sigmoid curve is obtained.

7.6 Differentiation, De-Differentiation, ReDifferentiation :
a. Differentiation :
It is maturation of cells derived from apical
meristem of root and shoot. Permanent change
in structure and function of cells leading to
maturation, is called differentiation. During
cell differentiation, cell undergoes few to
major anatomical and physiological changes
e.g. Parenchyma in hydrophytes develops
large schizogenous interspaces for mechanical
support, buoyancy and aeration. The maturation
is at the cost of capacity to divide and redivide.
b. Dedifferentiation :
The living differentiated cell which has
lost the capacity to divide, may regain the same
as per the need and divide. Thus, permanent
(mature) cell undergoes dedifferentiation and
becomes meristematic e.g. interfascicular

137

cambium and cork cambium are formed from
parenchyma cells between vascular bundles
and inner most layer of cortex, respectively.
c. Redifferentiation :
The cells produced by dedifferentiation
once again lose the capacity to divide and
mature to perform specific function. This
is called redifferentiation e.g. secondary
xylem and secondary phloem are formed
from dedifferentiated cambium present in the
vascular bundle.

stage show different forms of leaves in the same
plant e.g. heterophylly in cotton, coriander,
larkspur (Delphinium). The environmental
heterophylly is shown by Ranunculus flabellasis
(butter cup). The intrinsic plasticity is found in
coriander and cotton. Heterophylly is exhibited
in the same plant in different growth phases or
under different environmental conditions.

7.7 Development :
It refers to the ordered or progressive
changes in shape, form and degree of
complexity. It includes all the changes occurring
in sequence from the germination of seed upto
the senescence or death during life cycle of
plants. Thus development includes growth,
morphogenesis, maturation and senescence.

7.8 Plasticity :
It is the capacity of being moulded, formed
or modeled. It is the ability of plants to form
different kinds of structures (i.e. to change) in
response to different environmental (external)
or internal stimuli, in various phases of life.
In many plants, juvenile stage and mature

7.9 Growth Hormones :
The term ‘hormone’ was coined first by
Starling (1906) in animal physiology. The
internal factors that influence growth are called
growth hormones or growth regulators as they
inhibit, promote or modify the growth. Growth
promoters are auxins, gibberellins (GA) and
cytokinins (CK). Growth inhibitors in plants
are ethylene and abscissic acid (ABA). All
phytohormones are growth regulators.

138

Know the Scientist :
The auxin is the first hormone to be
discovered in plants. Discovery of auxins
dates back to 19th century when Charles
Darwin (1886) was studying tropism in
plants. He exposed canary grass coleoptile to
unilateral light. He concluded that a growth
stimulus is developed in the coleoptile tip
and transmitted downwards to the growth
zone. This has caused bending of the tip
towards light.
The Danish plant physiologist Boysen
- Jensen (1910) cut off the colepotile and
inserted thin plate of gelatin beween the
tip and the cut stump. He observed that
coleoptiles tip still bends towards unilateral
light.
Paal (1919) cut off the tip of colepotile
and replaced it asymmetrically on the
cut coleoptile stump. He observed that
the colepotile tip bent away from the side
bearing tip even in dark.
F.W. Went (1928) successfully isolated
natural auxin from Avena coleoptile tips.
He cut off the tip and placed them on small
agar blocks. Then after certain period of
time placed the agar blocks asymmetrically
on cut coleoptile stump that caused bending.
He demonstrated the presence of substance
which could diffuse into agar blocks. Went
named this substance as auxin.

According to Thimann and Pincus (1948)
“Plant hormones are organic substances
produced naturally in higher plants affecting
growth or other physiological functions at a site
remote from its place of production and active
in very minute (optimum) amount”. Hormones
are transported through phloem parenchyma
(Phillips 1971).

F. W. Went in 1931, used this term first.
Auxin was isolated from urine of a person
suffering from Pellagra (Kogl and H. Smit
1931). In plants, it is synthesized in growing
tips or meristematic regions of plants from
where it is transported to other plant parts. The
most common and important natural auxin is
Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Tryptophan is the
primary precursor of IAA in plants. It is the
first hormone to be discovered in plants and
is primarily responsible for cell elongation. It
shows polar transport - Basipetal transport in
stem. Now synthetic auxins like IBA (Indole
butric acid), NAA (Naphthalene acetic acid),
2, 4-D pichloro (Phenoxy acetic acid), etc. are
used.
Physiological effects and applications of
auxin:
The primary effect is cell enlargment. In
most of the higher plants, growing apical bud
inhibits the growth of lateral buds. This is called
as apical dominance. Auxin stimulates growth
of stem and root. Auxin induces multiplication
of cells, hence used in tissue culture experiments
to produce callus. It stimulates formation
of lateral and adventitious roots. These are
marketed as synthyetic herbicides. e.g. 2, 4-D
(2,4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid). It kills dicot
weeds without affecting monocot crop plants.
The seedless fruits like orange, lemon,
grapes, banana etc. are produced by application
of auxin (i.e. induced parthenocarpy). Auxins
promote cell division in cambium and also cause
early differentiation of xylem and phloem. It
139

promotes root elongation in low concentration
and shooting at higher concentration. It
also hastens early rooting in propagation by
‘cutting’.
Foliar spray of NAA and 2,4-D induces
flowering in litchi and pineapple. Likewise, it
prevents premature fruit drop in apples, pear
and oranges, and also prevents formation
of abscission layer. Auxins play a role in
elongation of cell. It is known to increase rate
of respiration. Auxins break dormancy in seed
and promote quick germination.
Do you know ?
Agent orange : Mixture of two phenoxy
herbicides in easter form. 2, 4-D and 2,4, 5-T
(dioxin) is known as agent orange used in
Vietnam war for defoliation of forests.
b. Gibberellins :
It is another growth promoting hormone
and is abundant in root tip and developing
seeds. It shows non-polar transport through
vascular tissue.
Gibberellins were first isolated from the
fungus Gibberella fujikuroi by Japanese scientist
Kurosawa (1926). He observed that when
rice plant was infected by fungus Gibberella
fujikuroi, it shows extensive stem elongation
called‘bakane disease’. The crystalline form
of Gibberellins were isolated by Yabuta and
Sumiki (1938) from the fungus culture. They
named it as gibberellin. It is synthesized in
young leaves, seeds, roots and stem tips. These
are synthesized from mevalonic acid. More
than 150 chemical types are known so far.
GA3 is most common and biologically active
form. Chemically it contains a gibbeane ring a cyclic diterpene with four isoprene units.
Physiological effects and application of
Gibberellins :
Dormancy of bud can be broken by
gibberellin treatment. It can promote seed
germination in cereals like barley and wheat

by synthesizing hydrolysing enzyme amylase
to produce sugar. The most striking effect of
it, is the elongation of stem where internodes
increase in length. It also promotes bolting i.e.
elongation of internodes just prior to flowering
in plants those with rosette habit e.g. beet,
cabbage. It causes parthenocarpy in tomato,
apple and pear, and flowering in long day
plants. It is used to increase the fruit size and
bunch length of grapes. When gibberellins
are applied on genetically dwarf plants
like maize, the stem rapidly elongates and
acquires the height of normal tall varities of
maize. Application of gibberellins overcomes
the requirement of vernalization. Usually, it
inhibits growth of root, delays senescence and
prevents abscission. It also breaks dormancy of
seed and hastens germination. Application of
gibberellin causes production of male flowers
on female plant.
c. Cytokinin :
It is another growth hormone that promotes
cell division. Letham coined the term cytokinin.
The first cytokinin was discovered by Skoog
and Miller (1954) during investigation of
nutritional requirements of callus tissue
culture of Nicotiana tabacum (Tobacco).They
observed that the callus proliferated when
the nutrient medium was supplemented with
coconut milk and degraded sample of DNA
(obtained from herring sperm). They named
it as kinetin. Chemically kinins are 6-furfuryl
amino purine. First natural cytokinin was
obtained from unripe maize grains by Letham
et al. It is known as Zeatin. 6-benzyl adenine is
a synthetic cytokinin hormone. Seven different
types of cytokinins are recorded from plants.
Natural cytokinins are also reported from
plants like Banana flowers, apple and tomato
fruits, coconut milk, etc.
Physiological effects and applications of
cytokinin :
Besides cell division, it also promotes cell
enlargment. High cytokinin promotes shooting.

140

A low ratio of cytokinin to auxin induces root
development but a high ratio causes buds and
shoot to develop. Cytokinin and auxin ratio
and their interactions controls morphogenic
differentiation. It promotes the growth of
lateral buds and controls apical dominance by
cell division. It delays the senescence or ageing
and abscission processes in plant organs. This
was reported by Richmond and Lang (1957).
Formation of interfasicular cambium and
expansion of cells are other functions. It also
breaks dormancy and promotes the germination
of seeds. Cytokinin reverses apical dominance
effect. It induces RNA synthesis and formation
of interfascicular cambium.
d. Ethylene :
It is the only gaseous growth regulator.
Denny (1924) reported ethylene is effective
in fruit ripening. Gane (1934) established that
plants naturally synthesize ethylene. Crocker
(1930) proposed that ethylene is the plant
hormone responsible for fruit ripening. It is a
simple gaseous hydrocarbon with essential
role in the fruit ripening. The most widely used
compound as a source of ethylene is ethephon.
It is synthesized in roots, shoot apical meristem,
ripening fruits etc.
Do you know ?
Ethret / Ethephon is a 2-chloroethyl
Phosphoric acid, which releases ethylene
after dissolving in water.
Physiological effects and application of
ethylene :
It promotes ripening of fruits like bananas,
apples and mangoes. It stimulates initiation of
lateral roots in plants and breaks the dormancy
of bud and seed.
It accelerates the abscission activity
in leaves, flowers and fruits by forming of
abscission layer. Ethylene inhibits the growth
of lateral buds and causes apical dominance
and retards flowering. It is associated with

the enhancement of process of senescence of
plants organs. It inhibits flowering in most of
the plants except pineapple. It causes epinasty
(drooping) of leaves and flowers. It increases
activity of chlorophyllase enzyme causing
degreening effect in banana and Citrus fruits.
Internet my friend
Degreening: It is the process of decomposition
of green pigment in fruits usually by applying
ethylene. This method is called trickle
degreening. Collect more information about
degreening.
e. Abscissic Acid :
It is a natural growth inhibiting hormone.
Carns and Addicott (1961-65) observed that the
shedding of cotton balls was due to a chemical
substance abscisin I and II. Wareing (1963)
isolated a substance from buds of Acer that can
induce bud dormancy and named it dormin.
These two identical chemical substances were
given the common name abscissic acid. It is
synthesized in leaves, fruits, roots, seeds etc.
Chemically, it is a 15-carbon sesquiterpenoid
and is synthsized from mevalonic acid.
Physiological effects and application of ABA:
It promotes abscission of leaves and
induces dormancy in many plants. It controls
the dormancy in buds and seeds by inhibiting
growth processes. It accelerates the senescence
of leaves, flowers and fruits. It inhibits and
delays cell division and cell elongation and
suppresses cambium activity by inhibiting
mitosis in vascular cambium. ABA could cause
efflux of k+ ions from the guard cells and
result in closure of stomata. So, it is known as
an antitranspirant. It acts as a stress hormone
by inducing the plant to bear the adverse
environmental conditions. It inhibits flowering
in long day plants but stimulates flowering in
short day plants.

the flowering behaviour in plants - Soyabean
and Meryland mamoth variety of tobacco.
They found that soyabean plant flowers during
late summer and tobacco variety during winter,
irrespective of their germination and growing
season. They studied effects of different
temperatures, nutrition, soil moisture, etc. in
respect of flowering. None of these were found
to regulate flowering. However, experimentally
they found that the exposure to specific duration
of light (i.e. photoperiod) had profound
influence on flowering. They examined the
effect of day length on flowering by using
artificial illumination. They concluded that
the relative length of the day was most crucial
in the growth and development of flowers to
which they coined the term photoperiodism.
Based on the photoperiodic response, plants
were classified in three categories viz, Short
Day Plants (SDP), Long Day Plants (LDP)
and Day Neutral Plants (DNP).

7.10 Photoperiodism :
Higher plants reproduce sexually by
producing special structures called flowers.
Plants exhibit transition from vegetative
growth to reproductive growth during which
flowers are produced. Like vegetative growth,
reproductive growth is also influenced by
several environmental and nutritional factors.
Among the environmental factors - light
and temperature exert profound influence on
flowering. The influence of light is known as
Photoperiodism and that of temperature, is
Vernalization.
Light as an environmental factor influences
germination of seed, vegetative growth,
photosynthesis, etc. Light as a factor as three
aspects viz, Quality, Intensity and Duration
of light. It is the duration of light that has
profound effect on flowering in higher plants.
The term photoperiodism was used by
Garner and Allard (1920). They were studying

Do you know ?
Organs for reception of photoperiodic
stimulus - Leaf is the chief organ for receiving
the photoperiodic stimulus as demonstrated by
Knoff (1934). Defoliated plants will not flower
even if the plants are exposed to proper duration
of light.
Photoperiodic stimulus - It is a chemical
stimulus transported through phloem and is
called florigen which is hormonal in nature.
Photochemical receptors in the leaves
are the biloproteins (pigments) located in the cell
membrane. These are called Phytochromes.
Blue wavelengths of light influences
flowering.

a. Short Day Plants (SDP) :
These plants usually flower during winter
and late summer when day length is shorter than
the critical photoperiod (critical photoperiod
is that length of photoperiod above or below
which flowering occurs). These are called

142

long night plants because they require long
uninterrupted dark period/ night for flowering.
If dark period is interrupted even by a flash
of light, SDP will not flower. Some of the
short day plants are Dahlia, Aster, Tobacco,
Chrysanthemum, Soybean (Glycine max),
Cocklebur (Xanthium), etc.
b. Long Day Plants (LDP) :
Plants that flower during summer are
called long day plants. They require longer
duration of light than the critical photoperiod,
for flowering. They are called short night
plants as they require short dark period. When
long dark period is interrupted by a brief flash
of light, LD plants can flower e.g. pea, radish,
sugar beat, cabbage, spinach, wheat, poppy,
etc.

Phytochrome :
Hendricks and Borthwick (1952) observed
that flowering in SD plants is inhibited, if dark
period is interrupted even by a flash of red
light of 660 nm. If it is immidiately followed
by far red light (730 nm), then SD plants will
flower. This observation led them to conclude
that some pigment system in plant receives the
photoperiodic stimulus. These pigment proteins
are called phytochromes.
The leaves produce light-receiving
proteinaceous pigment called phytochrome
that induces flowering. It exists in two
interconvertible forms viz, red (Pr) and far
red (Pfr). When Pfr absorbs far red light, it
is converted into Pr and vice versa. These
are located in the cell membrane of green
cells.

During day time, Pfr accumulates in
the plants. It inhibits flowering in SDP but
initiates flowering in LDP. During dark period
Pfr changes into Pr, it stimulates/ promotes
flowering in SDP and inhibits flowering in
LDP.

Control of morphogenesis by light and

c. Day Neutral Plants (DNP) :
These plants flower throughout the
year round, independent of duration of light
(photoperiod). They do not require specific
photoperiod to flower. Therefore, they are
called Day neutral plants e.g. Cucumber,
tomato, cotton, sunflower, maize, balsam, etc.

Melchers proposed that chilling treatment
may induce formation of hypothetical floral
hormone, vernalin.
7.11 Vernalization (Yarovization) :
Temperature as environmental factor
influences several physiological processes
including reproduction. Temperature as a
factor has three cardinal points viz, minimum,

143

optimum and maximum temperature. It is
a low temperature (chilling) treatment that
induces early flowering in plants as was
evidenced by Klippart (1918). Chouard (1960)
defines vernalization as accelaration of the
ability to flower by chilling treatment. The
term vernalization was coined by T.D Lysenko
(1928) for the effect of low temperature on
flowering in plants.
It is an influence of temperature on
development and flowering. Many plants
such as cereals, crucifers require a period of
cold treatment for flowering. It is the method
of inducing early flowering in the plants by
pretreatment to their seeds/ seedlings at low
temperature (1-60C for one to one and half
months’ duration). The site of vernalization is
believed to be shoot apical meristem. Generally,
vernalization is effective at seed stage in
annual plants. Vernalization stimulus is also a
chemical stimulus named as vernalin. This can
be transferred through grafting (Melcher 1939).
Know the Scientist :
The low temperature induces early
flowering which was first noticed by
Klippart (1957) while working on two
varieties of wheat- ‘winter wheat’ and ‘spring
wheat’. The winter wheat sown in winter,
produces flowers in the following summer.
The spring wheat sown in the spring and
produces flowers during summer. However,
if winnter variety is sown in spring does not
produce flowers during summer but does so
in the next year’s summer. He observed that
if germinated seeds of ‘winter wheat’ are
treated with low temperature, it can behave
as spring wheat. He concluded that winter
wheat requires low - temperature exposure
before the onset of flowering.
The reversion of vernalization by high
temperature treatment is called devernalization.

Advantages of vernalization :
• Crops can be produced earlier.
• Crops can be cultivated in regions where
they do not grow naturally.
7.12 Mineral nutrition :
Plant absorbs water, gases, mineral,
nutrients, etc. from surroundings. Green plants
for the synthesis of their organic food need
inorganic substances (elements) which are
obtained from soil in the form of minerals.
Minerals constitute most commonly occuring
solid, inorganic materials obtained from the
earth’s crust.
Chemical analysis of plant ash clearly
indicates that plant absorbs mineral elements
from surroundings (soil, air and water) for
its use. About 36 to 40 different elements of
periodic table are used as minerals by the
plants. These are absorbed in ionic (dissolved)
form as PO4 , CO3 , SO4 , etc.,usually through
roots (regions of elongation and growth).
Sources of minerals :
Plants derive necessary elements from the
atmosphere, soil and water. Carbon enters the
plant as atmospheric carbon-dioxide.
Source of hydrogen is water and oxygen
comes from air and water. Carbon, Hydrogen
and oxygen are not minerals in origin.
Source of nitrogen is the soil. Plant derives
nitrogen from both mineral and non-mineral
origin.
Classificaion of minerals :
Earlier, on the basis of their requirement
minerals were classified as essential and
non-essential. Essential minerals are those
that are indispensible without which plants
can not complete their life cycle e.g. C, H, O,
N, P, etc. These elements play structural and
physiological roles. Their absence can produce/
cause major deficiency symptoms. The nonessential elements are not indispensable and
they do not produce/ cause any deficiency
symptoms. This classification is absolete now.

144

Based on the quantity requirement, minerals
are classified as minor or microelements and
major or macroelements. Microelements are
required in traces because they function in
the catalytic role e.g. Zn, Cu, Al, Si, etc. as
co-factors. Macroelements are required in
large quantity. They mainly play the nutritive
and structural roles e.g. C, H, O, P, Mg, N, K,
S, etc. C, H, O are non mineral major elements.
This classification is not accepted now.
Know the Scientist :
Criteria for Essentiality of elements
proposed by Arnon and Stout (1939) : The
elements must be absolutely necessary for
supporting normal growth and reproduction.
These elements must be having specific
functions and should not be replaceable by
another element. The element must be directly
involved in the nutrition of the plant. If an
element satisfies all above three criteria, it is
considered to be an essential element.
Do you know ?
Liebig showed the Essentiality of
mineral nutrients and put forth the ‘Law of
minimum’. According to this law, the yield of
crop plant is determined by the amount of
essential element that is present (available) in
the minimum quantity.

Symptoms of Mineral deficiency in plants :
Any visible deviation from the normal
structure and function of the plant, is called
symptom or hunger sign. The concentration
of the essential elements below which plant
growth is retarded, is termed as critical
concentration.
The element is said to be deficient when
present below the critical concentration. Certain
morphological changes are indicative of the
deficiency of particular element. Deficiency
symptoms also depend on the mobility of
the elements in the plants. The deficiency
symptoms appear first in young tissues when
elements are relatively immobile e.g. sulphur,
calcium.
When the elements are actively mobilized
within the plants and exported to young
developing tissues, the deficiency symptoms
are visible first in the older tissues (senescent
leaves). e.g. nitrogen, magnesium, potassium.
Some important deficiency symptoms seen
in plants are:
• Stunting : The growth is retarded. The stem
appears condensed and short.
• Chlorosis : It is the loss or non-development
of chlorophyll resulting in the yellowing of
leaves
• Necrosis : It is the localized death of tissue
of leaves.
• Mottling : Appearance of green and nongreen patches on the leaves.
• Abscission : Premature fall of flowers,
fruits and leaves.

Now a days minerals are classified on the
basis of their biochemical functions.

Minerals salt absorption :
Most minerals in the soil are charged
particles hence, they can not pass across cell
membrane. Hence most of the minerals are
absorbed actively with the expenditure energy.
Minerals can also be absorbed passively
without expenditure of energy. Mineral ion
absorption is independent of water absorption.
Mineral ion absorption can occur in two
ways :
a. Passive Absorption : Movement of
mineral ions into the root occurs by diffusion.
Molecules or ions diffuse from a region of
their higher concentration to a region of their
lower concentration. The movement of mineral
ions into root cells as a result of diffusion is
without expenditure of energy is called passive
absorption. Passive absorption can take place
by direct ion-exchange, in direct ion-exchange
mass flow and Donnan equilibrium.

Do you know ?
• Constituents of protoplasm and cell
walls : C,H,O,N,P,S are important and
permanent constituents of the protoplasm
and the cell wall.
• Osmotic potential : The osmotic pressure
of cell is the result of mineral salts and
organic compounds dissolved in the cell
sap.
• Catalytic functions : Many elements
like Fe, Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, Cl, etc. act as
catalysts in various enzyme reaction of
plant metabolism.
• Permeability of cytoplasmic membrane:
Permeability of membrane is influenced
by the presence of the various ‘cations’
and ‘anions’ of the mineral elements in the
external medium like ca+, k+.
• Components of energy related chemical
compounds : Phosphorus in ATP and Mg
in chlorophyll.

b. Donnan equilibrium : It is based on the
assumption that certain negatively charged
ions, after their entry into the cell, become
fixed on the inner side of the cell membrane
and can not diffuse outside through the cell
membrane. Therefore, additional mobile
cations are required to balance these fixed
anions. Obviously concentration of cations
become more due to accumulation. This kind
of passive absorption of anions/ cations from
cell exterior against their own concentration
gradient in order to neutralize the effect of
cations/ anions, is called Donnan equilibrium.

Do you know ?
The atmospheric CO2 is virtually
the only source of carbon, which is the basic
constituent of all the organic compounds.

Toxicity of Micronutrients :
Mineral ion concentration which reduces
the dry weight of tissues by 10%, is considered
as toxic. Toxicity of one element may inhibit
the uptake of the other e.g. Mn competes with
Fe, Mg for uptake, but inhibits Ca translocation
to shoot apex. Thus, Mn toxicity develops
deficiency symptoms of Ca, Mg and Fe.

Active Absorption: Uptake of mineral ions
against concentration gradient, is called
active absorption, such movement requires an
expenditure of energy by the absorbing cell.
This energy is derived from respiration and
is supplied through ATP. When the roots are
deprived of oxygen, they show a sudden drop
in active absorption of minerals. The mineral
ions accumulated in the root hair pass into the
cortex and finally reach the xylem.

147

The minerals in the xylem are then carried
along with water to other parts of the plant along
the transpiration stream and are subsequently
assimilated into organic molecules and then
redistributed to other parts of the plant through
the phloem.
Do you know ?
To explain active absorption of minerals
Hoagland and Davis (1923) put forth Carrier
hypothesis. Specific proteins in the membrane
of root cells actively pump ions into the
cytoplasm of epidermal cells of root. These
proteins are called carriers that pump both
cations and anions from the soil. According to
Bennet and Clarke (1956) protein conjugated
with lecithin acts as carrier.

Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient in the
agricultural ecosystems. It exists as nitrogen
atoms with a strong triple covalent bond
(N ≡ N). A regular supply of nitrogen to the
plants is maintained through biological and
physical process.
Nitrogen fixation :
Atmosphere is the source of nitrogen. It
can not be used directly. It combines with C,
H, N and O to form compounds before being
used. Conversion of free nitrogen (N2) of the
atmosphere into nitrogenous salts to make
it available for the plants, is called nitrogen
fixation. It is of two types : Physical and
Biological fixation.

7.13 Nitrogen cycle:
It is series of natural processes by which
Nitrogen enters successively from air to
organisms through soil and back to environment.
Plants use photosynthetic product, the sugars to
make proteins. To do this, they need nitrogen.
Unfortunately, it is very innert (nonreactive).
Plants need nitrogen in a reactive form usually
as nitrate ions.

Symbiotic N2 fixation :
The best known nitrogen fixing symbiotic
bacterium is Rhizobium. This soil living/
dwelling bacterium forms root nodules in plants
belonging to family Fabaceae e.g. beans, gram,
groundnut etc.

Internet my friend
Enlist names of symbiotic and free living
nitrogen fixing bacteria.
Always Remember
Today nearly 80% of nitrogen found
in human tissues originate from the HaberBosch process.
Biological Nitrogen fixation : It is carried out
by prokaryotes called as ‘Nitrogen fixers’ or
Diazotrophs’. It accounts nearly 70% of natural
nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixers are either
symbiotic or free living. The cyanobacteria fix
significant amount of nitrogen in specialized
cells called heterocysts.
Nitrogen fixation is high energy requiring
process and nitrogen fixers use 16 molecules of
ATP to fix each molecule of nitrogen to form
ammonia.
N2 + 8H+ +8e- + 16ATP

Ammonia is then converted into amino acids.
Nitrification :
Most of the soil bacteria participate in
converting ammonia into nitrate, the form
of nitrogen which can be used by plants and
animals. This involves two steps performed by
two different types of bacteria.
First a soil bacteria convert ammonia into
nitrogen-di-oxide (nitrite) eg. Nitrosomonas,
Nitrosococcus, etc.

Ammonification :
After the death of plants and animals,
various fungi, actinomycetes and some
ammonifying bacteria decompose the tissues
and convert organic nitrogen into amino
acid and then to ammonia and back into the
ecosystem. Ammonia (NH4+) is now available
for uptake by plants and other micro-organisms
for growth.

nitrites and ammonia (NH4+). It is obsorbed by
the green plants and converted to nitrogenous
organic compounds like amino acids, DNA,
etc. This is known as nitrogen assimilation.
From plants, nitrogen as biomolecules like
amino acids, enters food chain and moves to
animals and then to decomposers through the
death of animals.
Nitrates are first converted to ammonia
but it is highly toxic and immediately used
for conversion into amino acids, which are
then transported to other parts of the plants for
synthesis of proteins.
NO3- + 2e- + 2H+

2HNO2 + 2 H2O

Then another type of soil bacterium called
Nitrobacter adds a third oxygen atoms to create
nitrate.

These bacteria are chemoautotrophs. By
metabolizing nitrogen along with oxygen, they
obtain energy to power their own life processes.

amino acids

NO2- +8e- + 8H+

NO2- + H2O
NH4+ + 2H2O

Amino Acid synthesis :
Amino acids are building blocks of proteins.
The amino acids are synthesized through :
Reductive amination : Ammonia reacts with
alpha ketoglutaric acid to form glutamic acid
(glutamate).

149

α Ketoglutaric acid + NH4 + NADPH2
Glutamate dehydrogenase
Glutamate +
H2O+ NADP
Transamination : Amino group of one amino
acid (-CHNH2) is transfered to keto position
(-CO) of other carboxylic acid.
Glutamic acid + oxaloacetic acid
Glutamate aspertate
Aminotransferase

α - Ketoglutaric acid +
Aspartic acid

Amides :
Ammonia may be absorbed by amino
acid to produce amides. The process is called
amidation. The amides are the amino acids
having two amino groups. Extra amino group is
attached to acidic group (-COOH) in presence
of ATP.
Glutamic acid + NH4++ ATP
alpha
glutamine + ADP
Aspartic acid + NH4++ ATP

Aspargine
+ ADP

Amides like asparagine and glutamine
are formed from glutamic acid and aspartic
acid respectively by addition of another amino
group to each. Amides are transported to other
parts of plants via xylem vessels.
Denitrification :
It is the process in which anaerobic bacteria
can convert soil nitrates back into nitrogen gas.
Denitrifying bacteria removes fixed nitrogen
i.e. nitrates from the ecosystem and return it to
the atmosphere in inert form.
Denitrifying bacteria includes Bacillus
spp., Paracoccus spp. and Pseudomonas
denitrificans. They transform nitrates to nitrous
and nitric oxides and ultimately to gaseous
nitrogen.

Respiration and Circulation
Can you recall?

1. Definition of respiration.
2. The types of cellular respiration.
3. Why should we respire all the time?
All living organisms require energy to
carry out various life processes. The energy
that is stored in the body in the form of complex
organic compounds (potential energy) is
however not usable by the organisms unless it
is converted into usable form. This conversion
is achieved through the process of respiration.

the cells of stem, leaf and root. These air
spaces are continuous. Oxygen diffuses into
the air space through stomata (the pores on
leaves and young stems), carbon dioxide and
water vapour diffuse out. In the aerated soil,
the oxygen dissolves in the film of moisture or
water around the root tissue and enters it by
diffusion.
Woody flowering plants (trees and shrubs)
have an external impervious bark. Here,
gaseous exchange occurs through small pores
in the stem surface, called lenticels.

Respiration : It is a biochemical process of
oxidation of organic compounds in an orderly
manner for the liberation of chemical energy in
the form of ATP.

For this, the process of gaseous exchange
takes place between the organism and the
environment. The site of gaseous exchange is
called the respiratory surface.

8.1 Organs of Respiratory Exchange :
Respiratory exchange is a simple physical
process. For efficient gaseous exchange, the
respiratory surface should have the following
features :
a. It should have a large surface area.
b. It should be thin, highly vascular and
permeable to allow exchange of gases.
c. It should be moist.
Gaseous exchange in plants :
The shape and structure of plants facilitate
gaseous exchange by diffusion. A terrestrial
flowering plant has many air spaces between

Respiration in Animals :
As compared to plants, animals show wide
variety of respiratory surfaces or organs. The
respiratory surfaces differ in various animals.
In animals, depending upon the complexity
of organization and the surrounding medium,
certain parts of the body have become
specialized into different types of respiratory
organs. In the higher animals, these respiratory
organs are also associated with a transport
system.

8.2 Human Respiratory system:
The respiratory system brings about
inspiration, expiration and exchange of gases
in the lungs. These are then transported by
blood from the lungs to the different tissues
and parts of the body. The respiratory system
and be divided into an upper respiratory system
having external nares, nasal cavities, internal
nares, nasopharynx, nose, throat and associated
structures. The lower respiratory system refers
to the larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and
lungs.

Nose :
The nose has a pair of slit like openings
called external nares or nostrils for entry of
air into the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity is
divisible into right and left nasal chambers by
a mesethmoid cartilage. Each nasal chamber
is further divided into three regions.
i. Vestibule : It is the proximal part about
the nostrils. Its skin has hair for filtering
the air and traping the dust and suspended
particles in the inhaled air.
ii. Respiratory part (conditioner) : The
middle thin walled highly vascular part for
warming and moistening the inhaled air.
iii. Olfactory or sensory chamber : The
uppermost part is lined by olfactory
epithelium for detection of smell.
Pharynx :
It is divisible into three parts. The
nasopharynx is the uppermost part from
the nasal chamber it leads into oropharynx
(common passage for food and air). This

154

continues below as the laryngopharynx.
Between the nasopharynx and oropharynx
is the palate bone. The pharynx has a set of
lymphoid organs called tonsils.

Larynx :
It is called voice box. It is the part of the
respiratory tract which contains vocal cords
for producing sound. The larynx extends from
the laryngopharynx and the hyoid bone to the
trachea. It is a hollow, tubular structure. Its
wall is made up of cartilage plates held by
membranes and muscles. Internally, it is lined
by a pair of folds of elastic vocal cords (true
vocal cords). Voice is produced by passage of
air between the vocal cords and modulations
created by tongue, teeth, lips and nasal cavity.
The larynx opens into the layngopharynx
through a slit like opening called glottis. This
opening of the trachea or wind pipe is guarded
by a leaf like flap called epiglottis. It prevents
the entry of food into trachea.

rings of cartilage which prevent the collapse
of trachea. It is lined internally with ciliated,
pseudostratified epithelium and mucous glands
that trap the unwanted particles preventing
their entry into the lungs.

Bronchi :
The trachea divides into right and left
primary bronchi as it reaches the middle of
the thoracic cavity. The bronchi are supported
internally by ‘C’ shaped incomplete rings of
cartilage. The primary bronchi divide to form
secondary and tertiary bronchi which lead into
terminal bronchioles ending into alveoli.
Lungs :
These are the main respiratory organs of
humans. One pair of spongy and elastic lungs
are present in the thoracic cavity. Each lung
is enclosed and protected by a double pleural
membrane, outer parietal and inner visceral
membrane. Between the two pleura is a pleural
cavity filled with a lubricating fluid called
pleural fluid. It is secreted by the membranes.
The right lung is larger and divided into 3 lobes,
while the left lung is smaller and divided into
2 lobes. Each lobe of the lung has the terminal
bronchioles ending in a bunch of air sacs, each
with 10 to 12 alveoli.
Alveoli :
These are thin walled lobulated structures,
like a bunch of grapes. Each alveolus is
surrounded by a network of capillaries of
pulmonary artries and veins. These have
highly elastic wall made up of a single layer

155

of squamous epithelium resting on a basement
membrane of connective tissue. There are
about 700 million alveoli in the lungs and
they provide the surface area for exchange of
gases.

8.3 Mechanism of respiration :
Respiration is a biological process
involving exchange of gases between the
atmosphere and the lungs and it results in the
formation of ATP. It includes the following
processes:
A. Breathing
B. External respiration
C. Internal respiration
D. Cellular respiration

(running, climbing stairs etc) (c). After the
vigorous activity. Do you find any difference
in the count?
a. Inspiration
(Breathing in)

A. Breathing :
It is a physical process by which gaseous
exchange takes place between the atmosphere
and the lungs. It involves inspiration and
expiration (see fig. 8.5). Both these steps
involved parts of the thoracic cage, the ribs,
sternum and the intercostal muscles and
muscles of the diaphragm.
Inspiration : During inspiration, the
atmospheric air is taken in to the lungs. It
occurs due to the pressure gradient formed
between the lungs and the atmosphere. It is
an active process in which the diaphragm
becomes flat and goes downward, the external
intercostal muscles contract so the ribs and
sternum move upward and outward. This leads
to an increase in the thoracic volume and a
decrease in pressure of thorax and the lungs.
To equalize the low pressure inside the lungs,
air from the atmosphere rushes into lungs. This
is inspiration.
Expiration : During expiration, the thorax
contracts causing air to be exhaled. The
diaphragm relaxes and is pushed upwards. It
becomes dome shaped. The intercostal muscles
also relax pulling the rib cage inward and
downward. This causes a decrease in thoracic
volume and leads to increase in pressure in
the thorax and the lungs as compared to the
atmospheric pressure. So air from the lungs
rushes out. This is expiration.
One inspiration and one expiration is one
breath.

B. External respiration/ Exchange of gases at
the alveolar level :
An alveolus consists of a layer of simple
squamous epithelium resting on a basement
membrane. It is intimately associated with a
dense network of capillaries. The capillary wall
is also made up of simple squamous epithelium
resting on a thin basement membrane. Both
the layers have similar structure and are thin
walled. Together they make up the respiratory
membrane through which gaseous exchange
occurs i.e. between the alveolar air and the
blood.
Diffusion of gases will take place from
an area of higher partial pressure to an area of
lower partial pressure until the partial pressure
in the two regions reaches equilibrium.
The partial pressure of carbon-dioxide of
blood entering the pulmonary capillaries is
45 mmHg while partial pressure of carbondioxide in alveolar air is 40 mmHg. Due to this
difference, carbon dioxide diffuses from the
capillaries into the alveolus.
Similarly, partial pressure of oxygen of
blood in pulmonary capillaries is 40 mmHg
while in alveolar blood it is 104 mmHg. Due to
this difference oxygen diffuses from alveoli to
the capillaries.

Pulmonary volumes and capacities
(Normal values)
Lung Volumes :
Tidal volume (T.V.) : It is the volume of air
inspired or expired during normal breathing.
It is 500 ml.
Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) : The
maximum volume of air, or the extra volume
of air, that is inspired during forced breathing
in addition to T.V. Its value is 2000 to 3000ml.
Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) : The
maximum volume of air that is expired during
forced breathing after normal expiration. Its
value is 1000 to 1100ml.
Dead space (DS) : The volume of air that is
present in the respiratory tract (from nose to
the terminal bronchioles), but not involved in
gaseous exchange. It is 150 ml.
Residual volume (RV) : The volume of air
that remains in the lungs and the dead space
even after maximum expiration. It is 1100 to
1200ml.
Lung capacities :
Total Lung capacity : The maximum amount
of air that the lungs can hold after a maximum
forcefull inspiration (5200 to 5800ml).
Vital capacity (VC) : The maximum amount
of air that can be breathed out after a
maximum inspiration. It is the some total of
TV, IRV and ERV and is 4100 to 4600ml.

i. Transport of oxygen :
Of the total oxygen transported only
3% is transported in a dissolved state by the
plasma. The remaining 97% is bound to
the haemoglobin (Hb) present in the RBCs.

157

Haemoglobin acts as the respiratory carrier. It
has a high affinity for O2 and combines with
it to form oxyhaemoglobin. Theoretically, one
molecule of Hb has 4 Fe++, each of which can
pick up a molecule of oxygen (O2).
Hb + 4O2
Hb (4O2)
Oxyhaemoglobin is transported from lungs
to the tissues where it readily dissociates to
release O2.
Hb + 4O2
Hb (4O2)
However, the degree of saturation of Hb
with O2 depends upon the O2 tension i.e. ppO2.
• 100% saturation is rare.
• Maximum saturation of 95 to 97% is at
ppO2 in alveoli (100 mmHg).
• Degree of saturation decreases with the
drop in ppO2. This begins the dissociation
of HbO2.
•

At 30 mmHg of ppO2, only 50% saturation
can be maintained.

•

The relationship between HbO2 saturation
and oxygen tension (ppO2) is called
oxygen dissociation curve. This oxygen haemoglobin dissociation curve is a sigmoid
curve and it shifts towards the right due to
- increase in H+ concentration, increase in
ppCO2 and rise in tempreature and rise in
DPG (2, 3 diphosphoglycerate), formed in
the RBCs during glycolysis. It lowers the
affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen.

Bohr effect : It is the shift of oxyhaemoglobin
dissociation curve due to change in partial
pressure of CO2 in blood.
Haldane effect : Oxyhaemoglobin functions
as an acid. It decreases pH of blood. Due to
increase in the number of H+ ions, HCO-3
changes into H2O and CO2.
In the alveoli where ppO2 is high and ppCO2
is low, oxygen binds with haemoglobin, but in
the tissues, where ppO2 is lower and ppCO2 is
high, haemoglobin does not hold as much O2.
It releases O2 for diffusion into the tissue cells.

Oxygen ppO2 (mm Hg)

Graph 8.7 : Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation
curve (pp = partial pressure)
Carbon monoxide poisoning :
Affinity of haemoglobin for carbon
monoxide is about 250 times more, than for
oxygen. In the presence of carbon monoxide,
haemoglobin readily combines to form a
stable compound carboxyhaemoglobin.
The haemoglobin is blocked by carbon
monoxide, preventing oxygen from binding
with haemoglobin. Thus, less haemoglobin
is available for oxygen transport depriving
the cells of oxygen. This is carbon monoxide
poisoning.

ii. Transport of CO2 :
Carbon dioxide is readily soluble in water
and is transported by RBCs and plasma in three
different forms.
a. By plasma in solution form (7%) : Only
7% of CO2 is transported in a dissolved form as
carbonic acid (which can breakdown into CO2
and H2O).

158

CO2 + H2O

H2CO3

b. By bicarbonate ions (70%) : Nearly 70%
of carbondioxide released by the tissue cells
diffuses into the plasma and then into the RBCs.
• In the RBCs, CO2 combines with water in
the presence of a Zn containing enzyme,
carbonic anhydrase to form carbonic acid.
• Carbonic anhydrase enzyme is found in the
RBCs and not in the plasma.
• The rate of formation of carbonic acid
inside the RBC is very high as compared to
its formation in the plasma.

and chemical. Human adults breathe about 12
times/minute while a new born about 44 times/

process. Steady rate of respiration is controlled
by neurons located in the pons and medulla
and are known as the respiratory centres. It

During inspiration when the lungs expand
to a critical point, the stretch receptors are
stimulated and impulses are sent along the
vagus nerves to the expiratory centre. It then
sends out inhibitory impulses to the inspiratory
center.
The inspiratory muscles relax and
expiration follows. As air leaves the lungs
during expiration, the lungs are deflated and
the stretch receptors are no longer stimulated.
Thus, the inspiratory centre is no longer
inhibited and a new respiration begins. These

Ventilator :
A ventilator is a machine that supports
breathing and is used during surgery, treatment
for serious lung diseases or other conditions
when normal breathing fails. It is mainly used
in hospitals as part of life support system.
Ventilators do the following,
1. Get oxygen into the lungs.
2. Remove carbon dioxide from the lungs.
3. Help the patient breathe.

8.7 Transportation in living organisms :
All
living
organisms,
whether
unicellular or multicellular show an important
property of exchange of material with their
surrounding as well as between various parts
of the their cell or body.

Observe and Discuss

↑

Artificial ventilation :
It is also called artificial respiration. It is the
method of inducing breathing in a person when
natural respiration has ceased or is faltering. If
used properly and quickly, it can prevent death
due to drowning, choking, suffocation, electric
shock, etc. The process involves two main steps
: establishing and maintaining an open air
passage from the upper respiratory tract to the
lungs and force inspiration and expiration as in
mouth to mouth respiration or by mechanical
means like ventilator.

Why is it difficult to hold one’s breath
beyond a limit?

↑

Think about it

The wastes generated within are given out into
the surrounding.
Transportation in organisms and
animals occurs by diffusion and by active
transport between the cells. This mechanism is
suitable where the surface area of body is large
and the distance between parts of the body in
the organism is extremely small. Cyclosis is the
streaming movement of the cytoplasm shown by
almost all living organisms e.g. Paramoecium,
Amoeba, root hair cells of many plants and
WBCs in animals. It is for transportation
within the cell or intracellular transport. In
sponges and coelenterates the surrounding
water is circulated through the body cavities.
In flat worms there is parenchymal circulation.
In round worms there are no blood vessels and
the body fluid is moved around the viscera by
contraction of body wall and muscles. This is
extracellular transport.

8.8 Circulation in animals :
In higher animals the circulation is
carried out by special fluids blood and lymph.
Blood vascular system :
Higher animals from Annelida to
chordata have a special circulating fluid, the
blood which is pumped to the tissues by the
heart through the blood vessels.
Types of blood vascular system :
1. Open circulation : In animals having
an open circulation, blood is circulated
through the body cavities (haemocoels).
The visceral organs lie in the blood filled
body cavity. Exchange of material takes
place directly between blood and cells or
tissues of the body. The blood flows with
low pressure and usually does not contain
any respiratory pigment like haemoglobin,
so it does not transport respiratory gases.
e.g. Arthropods (cockroach, studied in 11th
std.) and Molluscs.

2. Closed circulation : In all the vertebrates,
higher molluscs and annelids, blood is
circulated all over the body through a
network of blood vessels. In this type of
circulation, blood flows within the blood
vessels and does not come in direct contact
with cells and body tissues. Exchange of
material between blood and body tissues is
through an intermediate fluid called lymph.
Blood flows with high pressure and contains
respiratory pigments like haemoglobin for
transportation of respiratory gases.
The closed circulation can be divided into
two main types : single and double circulation.
Single circulation : In single circulation, the
blood passes through heart only once during
each cycle as in fishes. Deoxygenated blood
is pumped from heart towards gills, where
it undergoes oxygenation. This oxygenated
blood moves towards various body parts, gets
deoxygenated and returns back to heart for
next cycle.

Since, the heart of fish carries only
deoxygenated blood, it also called ‘venous
heart’.
Double circulation : In double circulation,
blood passes through heart twice during each
cycle; it occurs in birds and mammals. In these
animals, heart pumps deoxygenated blood to
lungs for oxygenation and it returns to heart
as oxygenated blood. This is ‘pulmonary
circulation’. The oxygenated blood is pumped
from the heart towards various body parts
(except lungs) and returns back to the heart
as deoxygenated blood. This is ‘systemic
circulation’. Human heart shows double
circulation.

Blood Composition and Coagulation : Study
of blood is called haematology. An average
adult has about 4 to 6 liters of blood. It is a red
coloured fluid connective tissue derived from
embryonic mesoderm. It is slightly alkaline
(pH 7.4), salty and viscous fluid. It is heaviere
then water. It has two main components- the
fluid plasma (55%) and the formed elements
i.e. blood cells (44%). These can be separated
by centrifugation.

Blood vascular system :
In human beings it consists of blood, heart
and blood vessels. It is responsible for various
functions like transport, homeostasis and
protection.

Formed elements :
The blood cells that are produced in the
body are collectively called formed elements.
Human blood contains three types of formed
elements as red blood corpuscles (RBCs), white
blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets.

164

8.10 Red blood corpuscles / Erythrocytes :
Do you know ?

Erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in
the human body. They are circular, biconcave
and enucleated (in camel and llama they are
nucleated).

Each erythrocyte approximately contains
270 million molecules of haemoglobin.
Normal content of haemoglobin in blood of
men is about 14 – 17 gm% and in women
it is about 13 – 15 gm%. Condition with
less number of RBCs or less amount of
haemoglobin or both is called as anaemia.
Each molecule of haemoglobin is a
protein-iron complex. It consists of four
polypeptide (globin) chains 2 alpha and 2
beta chains. An iron – porphyrin (haem)
group is attached to each chain and all
four chains are bound together. Each haem
group can carry one O2 molecule and thus
one haemoglobin molecule can carry four
O2 forming oxyhaemoglobin. CO2 interacts
with amino acid residues of globin chains
and forms carbaminohaemoglobin. After
haemolysis, haemoglobin is broken down.
Its globin part is broken to recycle the amino
acids. Iron of heme group is stored as ferritin
in the liver and porphyrin group of heme is
converted into green pigment biliverdin and
then into red-orange coloured bilirubin. These
pigments (mainly bilirubin) are added to bile
and finally removed out of body along with
faeces.

The red colour or RBCs is due to an oxygen
carrying pigment, the haemoglobin, in their
cytoplasm. In males, their average number
is about 5.1-5.8 million/mm3 (per µL) and in
females about 4.3-5.2 million/mm3. This is
called total RBC count. The average life span
of RBCs is 120 days. The process of formation
of RBCs is called erythropoiesis.
RBCs are produced from haemocytoblasts
/ reticulocytes. The erythropoeitic organ of the
foetus is the liver and spleen and in the adult,
it is mainly the red bone marrow. Vitamin
B12, folic acid and heme protein are required
for production of RBCs The old and worn out
RBCs are destroyed in the liver and spleen
(graveyard of RBCs). Condition with increase
in the number of RBCs is called polycythemia
and with decrease in number of RBCs is
called as erythrocytopenia. The hormone
erythropoietin produced by the kideny cells
stimulates the bone marrow for production of
RBCs.
Mature erythrocyte is devoid of nucleus,
mitochondria or other membrane bound cell
organelles. Its cytoplasm (stroma) is rich in
haemoglobin and O2 carrying proteinaceous
pigment that gives red colour to the RBCs and
blood. It also contains an enzyme, carbonic
anhydrase.
Erythrocytes are responsible for the
transport of respiratory gases O2 and CO2,
maintaining pH and viscosity of blood. They
also contribute in the process of blood clotting.
The hematocrit is ratio of the volume of RBCs
to total blood volume of blood. It is different
for men and women.

Internet my friend
1. Compare between myoglobin and
haemoglobin.
2. In the erythrocytes, nucleus and
mitochondria are absent. Explain?
8.11

White blood corpuscles / Leucocytes:
Leucocytes are colourless, nucleated and
amoeboid cells larger than RBCs.Due to their
amoeboid movement they can move out of the
capillary walls by a process called diapedesis.
A normal adult has on an average, 5000-11000
WBCs per mm3 of blood. Decrease in number of

165

WBCs (<4000) is called leucopenia (common
in HIV, AIDS and TB patients or those exposed
to radiations, shock, etc). Temporary increase in
number of WBCs is called as leucocytosis. It is
due to infection. It also occurs during pregnancy
and in newborn babies. Uncontrolled increase
in number of WBCs is a type of blood cancer
called leukemia. WBCs are mainly concerned
with defense mechanism i.e. protection.
Types of WBCs :
These are colourless, irregular nucleated
cells and show polymorphism (exist in variable
forms). They can be classified into two main
types such as granulocytes and agranulocytes.

a. Neutrophils : Granules are very fine, large
in number, evenly distributed and stained
with neutral stains (dyes). Neutrophils are
about 70% of total WBCs. These cells are
spherical and nucleus is several lobed (27). These are able to perform amoeboid
movements and phagocytosis. They are
responsible for destroying pathogens by the
process of phagocytosis. ‘Pus’ is mixture of
dead neutrophils, damaged tissues and dead
microbes.
Think about it
Why and when do the leucocytes perform
diapedesis?

A. Granulocytes :
These are WBCs with a granular
cytoplasm, also called Polymorpho nuclear
leucocyte (PMN) cells. They have lobulated
nuclei in different shapes. Granulocytes are
formed from myeloid stem cells and once
formed, do not divide. Granulocytes constitute
about 72% of total WBCs. Granules are
actually secretory vesicles which contain
various secretions, enzymes, etc. Depending
upon staining property of the granules, these
granulocytes are classified into three types as
neutrophils, basophils and acidophills.
Think about it
What are the granules in granulocytes?

b. Basophils / Cyanophils : These cells have
very few granules of large size, and stain with
basic stains like methylene blue. Basophils
are non-phagocytic, small, spherical cells and
are about 0.5-1% of total WBCs.. Nucleus
is twisted. They are present in infected and
allergic conditions only. Basophils secrete
heparin, histamine and serotonin.
c. Eosinophils / Acidophills : Acidophills
contain lysosomal granules that are stained
to red colour with acidic stains like eosin.
Eosinophils are about 1 – 3 % of total WBCs.
Nucleus is bilobed. They destroy antigenantibody complex by phagocytosis. Their
number increases in allergic condition and they
show antihistaminic property. They are also
responsible for detoxification as they produce
antitoxins.

B. Agranulocytes :
Agranulocytes are about 28% of total
WBCs. Cytoplasm of these leucocytes is
without granules. They are formed from
lymphoid stem cells and can divide by mitosis.
Nuclei of agranulocytes are large in size but
are not lobulated like the granulocytes. There
are two types of agranulocytes - Lymphocytes
and Monocytes.
a. Lymphocytes : Lymphocytes are the
smallest of all WBCs and have a large spherical
nucleus. They constitute about 25-30% of total
WBCs. Depending upon function, two types
of lymphocytes are present as B-lymphocytes
and T-lymphocytes. B-lymphocytes mature
in bone marrow and are responsible for
antibody production/humoral immunity. It is
a highly specific antigen, antibody immunity
T-lymphocytes mature in thymus and are
responsible for cell-mediated immunity. Helper
T-cells, killer T-cell, memory T-cells and
suppressor T-cells are four main subtypes of
T-lymphocytes.
b. Monocytes : Monocytes are the largest of
all the WBCs. Its nucleus is large and bean
or kidney shaped. They form 3-5% of WBCs.
Monocytes are actively motile and give rise
to macrophages. They are mainly phagocytic
and destroy the bacteria and dead or damaged
tissue by phagocytosis.

in number of neutrophils and the
importance of complete blood count
(CBC)?
2. Why and when are heparin, histamine
and serotonin secreted? Are these
biomolecules secreted by any other cell/
organ in our body?

8.12 Thrombocytes / Platelets:
Thrombocytes are cellular fragments
formed from the large cells called
megakaryocytes. These are produced in bone
marrow. They are very small, oval shaped cell
fragments without nucleus. Normal count of
thrombocytes in human blood is about 2.5 – 4.5
lakh / mm3 of blood. If number of thrombocytes
decreases than normal, condition is called as
thrombocytopenia. This condition causes
internal bleeding (haemorrhage). Platelets
secrete platelet factors which are essential
in blood clotting. They also seal the ruptured
blood vessels by formation of platelet plug/
thrombus. They secrete serotonin a local
vasoconstrictor.

Blood Clotting/ Coagulation of blood :
Clotting or coagulation is the process of
converting the liquid blood into a solid form.
This process may be initiated by contact
of blood with any foreign surface (intrinsic
process) or with damaged tissue (extrinsic
process). Intrinsic and extrinsic processes
involve interaction of various substances called
clotting factors by a step wise or cascade
mechanism. There are in all twelve clotting
factors numbered as I to XIII (factor VI is not
in active use). Interaction of these factors in
a cascade manner leads to formation of the
enzyme thrombin. Thromboplastin, helps in
the formation of enzyme prothrombinase. This
enzyme inactivates heparin and it also converts
inactive prothrombin into its active thrombin.

167

Thrombin converts soluble blood proteinfibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. Fibrin forms a
mesh in which platelets and other blood cells
are trapped to form the clot. Blood clotting
occurs as shown in the following flowchart.

layers of serous pericardium are separated by
a pericardial space. This space is filled with
pericardial fluid (about 50ml) which acts as
a shock absorber and protects the heart from
mechanical injuries. It also keeps the heart
moist and acts as lubricant.

8.13 Heart :
Heart is the main pumping organ of the
circulatory system. It is reddish brown in colour,
hollow, muscular organ, roughly the size of
one’s fist. Its average weight is about 300gm
in males and 250gm in females. It is conical in
shape and lies in mediastenum- i.e. the space
between two lungs. It is broader at upper end

Heart wall :
The heart is mesodermal in origin. Its wall
is formed of three layers, outer epicardium,
middle myocardium and inner endocardium.
Epicardium is thin and formed of a single
layer of flat squamous epithelium resting
on basement membrane. Myocardium is the
middle thick layer formed of cardiac muscles.
Endocardium is a single thin layer formed of
squamous epithelium. The epicardium and
endocardium are protective in function whereas
myocardium is responsible for contraction and
relaxation of heart.

168

External structure of heart :
The human heart is four chambered.
The two superior chambers are called
atria (auricles) and inferior two are called
ventricles. Externally, the atria are separated
from ventricles by a transverse groove called
coronary sulcus or atrioventricular groove.
The two ventricles are externally separated
from each other by two grooves, the anterior
and posterior inter-ventricular sulci. Coronary
arteries and coronary veins run through
these sulci. Pulmonary trunk arising from
right ventricle and aorta from left ventricle
are present on anterior surface of heart. The

pulmonary trunk bifurcates into right and left
pulmonary arteries. Aorta (systemic aorta) is
divisible into three regions as ascending aorta,
systemic arch /aortic arch and descending
aorta. The Ligamentum arteriosum joins
pulmonary trunk and aortic arch. It is the
remnant of an embryonic duct called ductus
arteriosus. The aortic arch gives out three
arteries viz. brachiocephalic (innominate)
artery, left common carotid and left subclavian. The right atrium recieves superior and
inferior vena cava along its dorsal surface.
Pulmonary veins open into left atrium along
the dorsal surface of heart.

Fig. 8.20 : Internal structure of human heart
Internal structure of heart:
Atria : These are the thin-walled receiving
chambers of heart. They are separated from
each other by inter-auricular septum. Interauricular septum has an oval depression called
fossa ovalis. It is a remnant of the embryonic
aperture called foramen ovalis.
Superior vena cava (precaval), inferior
vena cava (postcaval) and coronary sinus
open into the right atrium. Opening of the
postcaval is guarded by a Eustachian valve
while the Thebesian valve guards the opening
of coronary sinus into right atrium. Four
pulmonary veins open into the left atrium.
These openings are without valves.
Both the atria open into the ventricles
of their respective sides by atrioventricular
apertures. These openings are guarded by
cuspid valves. The tricuspid valve is present
in the right AV aperture and bicuspid valve
(mitral valve) is present in the left AV aperture.
All these heart valves help in maintaining a
unidirectional flow of blood. They also avoid
back flow of blood.
Ventricles : These are inferior, thick-walled
pumping chambers of the heart. The right
and left ventricles are separated by an interventricular septum. Wall of the left ventricle is
more muscular and about 3-times thicker than
the right ventricle. Inner surface of the ventricles

shows several ridges called columnae carnae
or trabeculae carnae which divide the lumen
of ventricle into small pockets or fissures. The
lumen of ventricles also shows inelastic fibers
called chordae tendinae. These attach the
bicuspid and tricuspid valves to the ventricular
wall (papillary muscles) and regulate their
opening and closing.
The right ventricle opens into the
pulmonary aorta and left ventricle opens into
the aorta. These openings are guarded by three
semilunar valves each. These valves prevent
the backward flow of blood into the ventricles.
Pumping action of heart :
The heart acts as the main pumping organ
of the circulatory system. The pumping action
is brought about by a rhythmic contraction
and relaxation of the cardiac muscles or heart
muscles. Contraction of heart muscles is systole
and relaxation of heart muscles is diastole.
A single systole followed by diastole
makes one heart beat. The heart beats 70 to
72 times per minute. This is called heart rate.
During each heart beat ventricles pump about
70 ml of blood this is called stroke volume.
It means heart pumps about 72 (heart rate) x
70 ml (stroke volume) = 5040 ml ≈ 5 liters of
blood per minute this is called cardiac output.

Fig. 8.21 : Conducting system of human heart
Conducting tissue of heart:
The human heart is myogenic i.e. the heart
is capable of generating a cardiac contraction
independent of nervous input. It also shows
auto rhythmicity i.e. it can generate its own
rhythm by specialized muscles. A specialized
cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is
distributed in the heart. A part of this nodal
tisse is present in the upper right corner of the
right atrium. It is called SA Node or Sinoatrial node. It lies at the base of opening of
superior vena cava. Another mass of nodal
tissue, the modified muscular fibers also called
autorhythmic fibers (conducting tissue) control
the beating rate of heart. Conducting (nodal)
tissue consists of SA node, AV node, bundle of
His and Purkinje fibers.
Conducting system of the heart :
SA node (sinu-atrial node) is present in
the right atrium. It acts as pacemaker of heart
because it has the power of generating a new
wave of contraction and making the pace of
contraction. SA node passes the contraction
to the left ventricle and also to the AV node.
AV node (atrio-ventricular node) is present in
the right atrial wall near the base of interatrial
septum. It acts as pace setter of heart.
Bundle of His/ Tawara branches start
from AV node and pass through interventricular
septum. Bundle of His forms two branches, the
right and left bundles, one for each ventricle.

These branches form network in ventricular
walls and these are called Purkinje fibers.
Bundle of His and Purkinje fibers spread
impulses in ventricles. As a result both the
ventricles contract simultaneously.
Do you know ?
Sometimes, valves are defective. Due to
this, abnormal or adventitious sound is heard,
called ‘heart murmuring’ or ‘hissing.’
8.14 Working mechanism of human heart :
Cardiac Cycle :
Human heart alternately contracts and
relaxes. Contraction is called systole and
relaxation is called diastole. Atria and
ventricles contract alternately. Consecutive
systole and diastole constitutes a single
heartbeat or cardiac cycle. It is completed in
0.8 sec. On an average, 72 beats are completed
in one minute in an adult, at rest.
a. Atrial systole (AS):
Right atrium receives deoxygenated
blood and left atrium receives oxygenated
blood. When both the atria are completely
filled with blood, pressure is exerted on the
wall. In response to this pressure, SA node
gets excited and generates cardiac impulse.
Due to this, cardiac muscles in the atrial wall
contract causing atrial systole. During atrial
systole, blood is pumped into ventricles. Blood

171

is prevented from going back to the veins and
coronary sinus by Eustachian and Thebesian
valve respectively. After completing systole the
atria go into diastole.
In normal conditions, atrial systole is for
0.1 sec. and atrial diastole (AD) is for 0.7 sec.
b. Ventricular systole (VS):
The impulse which started from SA node
now reaches the AV node and it gets excited. AV
node sends impulses to bundle of His and from
bundle of His to Purkinje fibers. Purkinje fibers
spread impulses all over the wall of ventricles.
Due to this, ventricular wall contracts causing
ventricular systole. During ventricular
systole, right ventricle pumps deoxygenated
blood into pulmonary trunk and left ventricle
pumps oxygenated blood into aorta. During
ventricular systole the cuspid valves close both
the atrioventricular apertures preventing blood
flow into atria (lubb sound is heard).
In normal conditions, ventricular systole
lasts for 0.3 sec. and ventricular diastole (VD)
lasts for 0.5 sec. During ventricular diastole,
semilunar valves are closed, preventing
backflow of blood from pulmonary trunk and
systemic aorta into ventricles (dub sound is
heard).
For about 0.4 second, both atria and
ventricles are in diastole. When all the
chambers of heart are in diastole, this condition
is called joint diastole or complete diastole.
Thus, duration of one cardiac cycle is 0.8 sec.

Right side of heart contains deoxygenated
and left contains oxygenated blood. Total
volume of blood pumped during one ventricular
systole is called stroke volume (SV) and it is it
approximately 70 ml.
Cardiac output (CO):
It is the volume of blood pumped out per
min. For a normal adult human being it is
calculated as follows :

(CO) = SV × HR
= 70 × 72 = 5040 ml/min
Regulation of cardiac activity :
Though human heart is myogenic,
it is also under dual control, the nervous
as well as hormonal. The nervous control
includes the part of autonomic nervous
system. Sympathetic system (with hormone
epinephrine as neurotransmitter) increase
the rate of heartbeat during emergency.
Parasympathetic system (with acetylcholine
as neurotransmitter) reduces rate of
heartbeat.
Nervous control includes the part
of the autonomous nervous system- its
cardiovascular center lies in the medulla
oblongata. It controls rate of heart beat in
response to inputs from various receptors like
proprio-receptors (which monitor the position
of limbs and muscles), chemoreceptors
(monitoring chemical changes in blood) and
baroreceptors (monitoring the stretching of
main arteries and veins).
Chemical control of the heart rate
includes the conditions like hypoxia,
acidosis, alkalosis causing decreased
cardiac activity, hormones like epinephrine
and norepinephrine enhance the cardiac
activity. Besides, concentration of cations
like K+, Ca++ and Na+ have major effect on
cardiac activity. Cardiac activity decreases
with the elevated blood level of K+ and Na+

8.15 Blood vessels :
There are three main types of blood vessels
in the human circulatory system viz, arteries,
veins and capillaries.
Arteries :
These blood vessels carry blood from heart
to various parts/organs of the body, there they
branch into arterioles and further into fine
capillaries. They normally carry oxygenated
blood to all parts of the body (except the
pulmonary artery which carries deoxygenated
blood). They are usually situated deep in the
body except a few like the radial, brachial,
femoral, etc. which are superficially located.
In a T. S. of artery, its wall shows three layers.
1. Tunica externa or tunica adventitia
2. Tunica media
3. Tunica interna or intima
The outermost tunica externa is a thick,
tough layer of collagen fibers. The tunica
media is made up of smooth muscles and
elastic fibres. This thick muscular and elastic
layer makes the arterial wall pulsatile. The
innermost tunica interna is a single layer of
flat compact endothelial cells surrounding the
lumen. The angular margin around the lumen
shows tesselations. Arterial lumen is devoid of
valves and blood flows through it rapidly and
with high pressure.

Fig. 8.23 : T. S. of Artery, Vein and Capillary

Veins :
Veins are thin walled, mostly superficial
vessels which carry blood from the organs
towards the heart. The capillaries around the
various organs join to form the veins. Except
for the pulmonary veins or other veins of the
body carry deoxygenated blood towards the
heart.
Portal vein : A portal vein e.g. hepatic portal
vein, differs from the other normal veins in
that its starts as capillaries from one organ and
capillarises in some intermediate organ e.g.
liver, before taking the blood towards the heart.
Histologically, the veins also show the three
layers like in the arteries. The tunica externa,
tunica media and tunica interna. However, the
tunica media is comparitively thiner and their
lumen is wide and narrow. Internal valves at
regular intervals can be seen. Blood flows with
flow pressure and the valves prevent backflow
of blood.
Capillary :
These are a network of minute blood
vessels. They are thin walled having a single
layer of flat squamous epithelium resting
on a single basement membrane. They are
mainly involved in exchange of materials.
Wall of capillaries is formed of single layer
of squamous epithelium and it is stretchable.
Blood flows through the capillaries under
high pressure. Wall of capillaries bear small
endothelial pores or fenestrae through which
blood cells (WBCs) can escape by the process
called as diapedesis.
Pulse : It is a series of pressure waves that
travel through the arteries due to ventricular
systole. It is the strongest in arteries closer
to the heart and gradually becomes weak in
arteries away from heart. It can be felt easily in
the superficial arteries like radial artery in the
wrist and carotid artery in the neck. The pulse
can be felt at particular points on the body. All
locations where the pulse can be felt are shown
in the figure 8.27.

higher than normal (above 100 beats/min)
is called tachycardia and slower pulse rate
(below 60 beats/min) than normal is called
bradycardia.

Why do the veins have valves?
8.16 Blood pressure (B. P.):
The pressure exerted by blood on the wall
of the blood vessels is called blood pressure.
It is measured by the sphygmomanometer. It is
usually measured from the arteries.
Arterial Blood Pressure:
Pressure exerted by blood on the wall of
artery is arterial blood pressure. Pressure on
arterial wall during ventricular contraction
(systole) is systolic pressure (SP). For a normal
healthy adult the average value is 120 mmHg.
Pressure on arterial wall during relaxation
of ventricles is diastolic pressure (DP). For a
normal healthy adult it is 80 mmHg.
B P = SP / DP
= 120/80 mmHg
Blood pressure is normally written as 120/80
mmHg. Difference between systolic and
diastolic pressure is called pulse pressure.
Normally, it is 40 mmHg.
Deviations from normal blood pressure
value indicate malfunctioning of heart. It
may be due to high or low blood volume,
arterial inelasticity or hardening of arteries

(arteriosclerosis), deposition of fats like
cholesterol in the arteries (atherosclerosis),
renal diseases and emotion induced hormonal
changes, obesity, etc. Blood pressure lower
than normal i.e. below 90/60 mmHg is called
hypotension and blood pressure higher than
normal i.e. above 140/90 mmHg is hypertension.
Various factors that affect the blood pressure
are cardiac output, peripheral resistance, blood
volume, length and diameter of blood vessels,
viscosity of blood, age, gender, venous return,
sleep, emotions, exercise, anxiety, etc.
Think about it
Why do obese persons are prone to
hypertension?
Normal cardiac output is 5 lit/min.
Increase in cardiac output increases systolic
pressure. Peripheral resistance depends upon
the diameter of blood vessels. Decrease in
diameter of arterioles and capillaries under the
effect of vasoconstrictors like vasopressin or
ADH cause increase in peripheral resistance
and thereby increase in blood pressure. Blood
loss in accidents decreases blood volume and
thus the blood pressure. Blood pressure is
directly proportional to Viscosity of blood.
Blood pressure increases with age due to
increase in inelasticity of blood vessels. Amount
of blood brought to the heart via the veins per
unit time is called the venous return and it is
directly proportional to blood pressure. Blood
pressure is also directly proportional to the total
length of the blood vessel. Blood pressure can
also be affected by vaso constriction or vaso
dilation. Females have slightly lower BP than
males her age before menopause. However, the
risk of high B. P. increases in the females after
menopause sets in.

called as Korotkoff sounds. Pressure in the
cuff is further lowered till any pulsatile sound
cannot be heard due to smooth blood flow. At
this moment, pressure indicated in manometer
is diastolic pressure. An optimal blood presure
(normal) level reads 120/80 mmHg.

Think about it
1.
1. Why the heart-recipient has to rely upon
life-time supply of immunosupressants?
2. Why the transplanted heart beats at higher
rate than normal?
Measurement of blood pressure:
Blood pressure is measured with the help
of an instrument called sphygmomanometer.
This instrument consists of inflatable rubber bag
cuff covered by a cotton cloth. It is connected
with the help of tubes to a mercury manometer
on one side and a rubber bulb on the other
side. During measurement, the person is asked
to lie in a sleeping position. The instrument
is placed at the level of heart and the cuff is
tightly wrapped around upper arm. The cuff is
inflated till the brachial artery is blocked due
to external pressure. Then pressure in the cuff
is slowly lowered till the first pulsatile sound
is heard.
At this moment, pressure indicated in
manometer is systolic pressure. Sounds heard
during measurement of blood pressure are

Hypertension :
Persistently raised blood pressure higher
than the normal is called hypertension. 140/90
mmHg is called as threshold of hypertension
and the 180/120 mmHg and higher readings
are dangerous to the health. It may damage the
heart, brain and kidneys.
Under the condition of hypertension,
heart uses more energy for pumping which
causes angina pectoris- the chest pains due
to lowered blood supply to cardiac muscles
and may lead to myocardial infarction. There
are more chances of brain hemorrhage due
to hypertension as arteries in brain are less
protected by surrounding tissues as compared
to other organs. In kidney, hypertension may
cause kidney failure.
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) :- It is also
known as atherosclerosis. In this, calcium, fat
cholesterol and fibrous tissues gets deposited
in blood vessels suppling blood to the heart
muscles making the lumen narrow.
Angina Pectoris :
It is the pain in the chest resulting
from a reduction in the blood supply to the
cardiac muscles because of atherosclerosis or
arteriosclerosis. It is charactarized by severe
pain and heaviness in the chest. The pain may
spread to the neck, lower jaw, left arm and
left shoulder. The pain usually results from
exertion, when there is more demand of oxygen
by the heart, but the supply does not meet the
requirement.

Fig. 8.25 : Sphygmomanometer

Angiography :
X-ray imaging of the cardiac blood
vessels to locate the position of blockages
175

is called angiography. Depending upon the
degree of blockage, remedial procedures like
angioplasty or by-pass surgery are performed.
In angioplasty, a stent is inserted at the site
of blockage to restore the blood supply while
in by-pass surgery, the atherosclerotic region
is by-passed with part of vein or artery taken
from any other suitable part of the body, like
hands or legs.
Heart Transplant :
Replacement of severely damaged heart
by normal heart from brain-dead or recently
dead donor is called heart transplant. Heart
transplant is necessary in case of patients with
end-stage heart failure and severe coronary
arterial disease.
Silent Heart Attack :
Silent heart attack, also known as silent
myocardial infarction is a type of heart attack
that lacks the general symptoms of classic heart
attack like extreme chest pain, hypertension,
shortness of breath, sweating and dizziness.
Symptoms of silent heart attack are so mild
that a person often confuses it for regular
discomfort and thereby ignores it. It has been
studied that men are more affected by silent
heart attack than women.

8.17 Electrocardiogram:
Graphical recording of electrical variations
detected at the surface of body during their
propagation through the wall of heart is
electrocardiogram (ECG). This recording
may be in the form of printout or onscreen
display. The instrument used for this recording
is the ECG machine or electrocardiograph.
This instrument detects and amplifies the
signals.
Various electrodes are used for recording
of signals. Four electrodes are positioned on
limbs; two on arms and two on legs. These are
limb electrodes. Six electrodes are positioned
on chest. These are chest electrodes.
In a normal record, three different waves
are recognized as P-wave, QRS complex and
T-wave. P-wave is a small upward deflection
from baseline of graph. It represents the atrial
depolarization. The QRS complex starts as
a slight downward deflection from baseline,
continues as sharp and large upright wave
and ends as a downward wave. QRS complex
represents the ventricular depolarization.
T-wave is small, wide and upwardly
elevated wave. It represents the ventricular
repolarization.

8.18 Lymphatic System :
Lymphatic system consists of lymph,
lymphatic vessels, some organs and tissues.
The word ‘lymph’ means ‘clear water’ and it
is a fluid connective tissue with almost similar
composition to the blood except RBCs, platelets
and some proteins. Fluid from intercellular
spaces of the body tissue enters into the
lymphatic vessels, from here it is discharged
into the blood vessels (veins) through the
thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct.

Tonsils are small lymphatic nodules in pharyngeal region. Normally there are five tonsils
strategically positioned to fight against inhaled and ingested foreign substances. Inflammation
of tonsils is called as tonsillitis. It is caused due to viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms
include sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nasal congestion, difficulty in swallowing,
headache, etc. Viral tonsillitis cures naturally but bacterial tonsillitis needs antibiotic treatment.
Tonsillectomy is performed in some patients who do not respond to the treatment.

Control and Coordination

Can you recall?
1. What is the need for the control and coordination in multicellular animals ?
2. How do plants carry out control and
coordination ?
Unicellular organisms have a simple
organisation of their life processes. However
a multicellular organisation of the body
organs and organ systems required both, a
control over their life processes as well as a
coordination between the various systems in
order to maintain homeostasis of the organism.
Plants and animals both show a control and
coordination mechanism. In plants this done
by sending chemical signals and brining about
various types of movements (e.g. phototropic,
chemotactic, thingmotactic, etc). Animals,
specially the higher vertebrates show a gradual
increase in the complexity of their control and
coordination by giving both electrical and
chemical singles. In this chapter now you will
study about development of nervous system
in different animal groups and details of the
system in humans.
The porifera (sponges) are the most
primitive of the animal phyla.
Can you recall?

cells form tissues, organs and systems which
must work in coordination with each other for
smooth internal functioning of the body. Also
the organism must be able to respond and
coordinate with respect to various stimuli or
changes in the external environment.
In the lower animals like Hydra and
Planaria the nervous system achieves this
function, while in higher more complex
animals, it is done by two coordinating systems
- the nervous (elctrical) system and endocrine
(chemical) control system. These two systems
will be studied separately though they work in
coordination with each other.
NERVOUS COORDINATION
9.1 Nervous System in Hydra :
Hydra, a cnidarian shows the diffused
nervous system, which is the most primitive
nervous system. The cnidarians are thus the
first animal group showing true simple nervous
system. It consists of the sensory cells and the
nerve cells or neurons along with their fibres.
The nerve cells are scattered or distributed
throughout the body and inter connected to
each other by synapses between their fibres to
form the nerve net. There are two nerve nets
both in the mesoglea, one connected towards
the epidermis and second towards the gastrodermis. There are sensory cells scattered in the

1. Do sponges have tissues and organs ?
2. Can sponges coordinate their various
functions ?

Tentacles

Even though there are different types of
cells in sponges for carrying out different
functions, a proper nervous system is lacking.
However to bring about efficient working of
the body these multicellular animals show
division of labour among the cells. This leads to
specialization of cells for the various activities
like digestion, respiration, excretion and others.
Later in the higher animals, phyla the different
182

body wall and tentacles, but sense organs are
lacking. Neurons have fibres but there are no
sensory and motor nerves. The nerve impulse
shows no polarity or direction. Thus in Hydra,
activation of sensory cells can happen at any
point, and from this point impulse can be carried
through out the body in any direction, thus
bringing movements of the body or tentacles
eg. catching of prey during feeding.
The diffused types of nervous system is the
first important landmark in the nervous system.
It is seen in the ctenophora as well as in the
enteric system or gut wall of higher animals
including man.
9.2 Nervous System in Planaria (flatworm) :
Planaria is a flatworm belonging to the
phylum platyhelminthes. It is the most primitive
animal with a central nervous system (CNS)
located on the ventral side of body. It consists
of a mass of cerebral or cephalic ganglion
appearing like an inverted U shaped brain.
These lie in the anterior or head region and from
each ganglion arise nine branches towards the
outer side. Ventrally from below the ganglia
arise a pair of Ventral Nerve Cords (VNC) or
long nerve cords. These are inter connected
to eachother by transfer nerve or commissure
in a ladder like manner. The peripheral nerve

Fig 9.2 Ladder type nervous system in
Flatworms e.g. Planaria

include sensory cells arranged in lateral cords
in the body. A pair of photosensory structure,
the eyes are located on dorsal side of the brain.
Also there are single sensory cells scattered in
the body.
In the above examples of Hydra, Planaria
and the earlier studied examples of cockroach
and humans, we have seen the gradual
evolution or changes of the neural system.
There is a high level of specialization in the
formation of neurons as electrically signalling
cells and also in the entire system, gradually
from a diffuse neural system to a centralized
nervous system. The expansion into a properly
organized system involving the brain, its
gradual expansion in size and functions.
This has lead to centralization of various
sense organs assisting in coordinating the
internal environment with that of the external
environment. Also there evolution of a complex
networking system which efficiently transmits
signals between one part or organ of the body
and another.

Activity :
Note the changes taking place in the
internal environment of the body, when a
person goes from resting state into a state of
physical activity.
9.3 Neural tissue
The neural tissue consists primarily of two
types of cells viz the neurons and the neuroglia
or glial cells. While a nerve is bundle of axons,
the word ‘nerve’ is used for a bundle of axons
outside the CNS while inside the CNS for the
same, word ‘tract’ is used. The nerves may be
sensory or motor or mix type i.e. having both
the types - sensory and motor fibres.
All these along with nervous organs make
up the nervous system of the higher animal and
bring about coordination and control of various
activities of the body. This is done through
the receptors which bring in sensory inputs
towards the central nervous system. Processing
is carried out in the CNS and then through the

1. How many neurons are present in the
human body and specifically in the brain?
2. Normally what percentage of cranial
capacity is used by an average human ?
3. What is the ratio between neurons and
neuroglia ?
Neurons/Nerve cells : These are the
structural and functional units of the nervous
system. (You may recall the structure of
a neuron studied in earlier classes). Each
multipolar neuron has three parts - cyton or
cell body, dendron and axon. The cyton has
a distinct central nucleus with a nucleolus

and neuroplasm. A clear film of cytoplasm
surrounds the nucleus around which there are
nurofibrils, Nissl’s granules and other cell
organelles Nissl’s granules are riboprotein
components. They play an important role
in the synthesis of the enzyme required for
formation of the neurotransmitter. Neurofibrils
play an important role in transmission of nerve
impulse. Dendrons are many small conical
processes arising from the cyton. These are
highly branched into fine dendrites. Nissl’s
granules and neurofibrils both can be seen
at the base of the dendrons. They transmit
message towards the cyton. Axon is a single
long, usually unbranched process arising
from the cyton at the axon hillock. It consists
of a bundle of neurofibrils. Nissl’s granules
are absent. Terminally, the axon gives out
branches called telodendrons. The axons carry
the messages away from the cytons. The axons
may give out lateral branches called collaterals.
The terminal branches attach to a muscle,
gland, skin or telodendrites of another neuron.
The interconnection between two neurons or
neuron with motor organ is called synapse. It is

These cells have few branches and mainly form the

the white matter of CNS. Myelin an isulating sheath
is made up of protein and fatty substances. It allows
quick transmission of electrical impulses.

Small sized cells with few branches. These are derived
Microglia or brain
from monocytes and act as macrophages. They go to

They support the functions of neurons.

usually axo-dendronic or may be axo-axonic,
axo-somatic or dendro-dendronic.
The cytons are generally found inside the
brain, spinal cord (CNS) and in the ganglia.
Small groups of cell bodies inside the white
matter of brain are called basal nuclei. A
bundle of axons called nerve may be covered
only by neurilemma in the non-medullated
nerves while in the medullated nerves it is
covered both by medullary sheath and on the
outside by neurilemma. Conduction of impulse
by the medullated nerves is 50 times faster than
in the non-medullated nerves. The connective
tissue covering around the nerve fascicule is
called endoneurium. Few nerve fasciculi with

endonurium are surrounded by connective
tissue, called perineurium and a still large
bundle of nerves is covered on the outer side by
epineurium. Blood is supplied to all the nerves
to provide oxygen and nutrients.
Neuroglial cells :
The neuroglial cells are far greater in
number than the neurons. Most of the supporting
cells of the nervous system are derived from the
same embryonic tissue layer (ectoderm) that
produces neurons. The term neuroglia refers
to the supporting cells of the Central Nervous
System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System
(PNS).

185

9.4 Synapse :
It is a junction between two nerve cells
with a minute gap (synaptic cleft) in between
them which allows transmission of impulse by
a neurotransmitter bridge.
1. Properties of nerve fibres :
a. Excitability/Irritability - The nerve fibres, on
account of presence of a polarised membrane,
have the ability to perceive stimulus and enter
into a state of activity.
b. Conductivity - It is ability to transmit the
excitation.
c. Stimulus - It is any detectable, physical,
chemical, electrical change in the external
or internal environment which brings about
excitation in a nerve/muscle/organ/organism.
In order to be effective, the stimulus must have a
minimum intensity called threshold stimulus.
Subliminal (weak) stimulus will have no
effect while supraliminal (strong) stimulus
will produce the same degree of impulse as the
threshold stimulus.
d. Summation effect -A single subliminal
stimulus will have no effect but if many such
weak stimuli are given in quick succession,
1

Presynaptic neuron

they may produce an impulse due to addition
or summation of stimuli.
e. All or none law - The nerve will either
conduct the impulse along its entire length or
will not at all conduct the impulse, as in case
of subliminal or weak stimulus.
f. Refractory period - It is the time interval
(about millisecond) during which a nerve fails
to respond to a second stimulus however strong
it is.
g. Synaptic delay - The impulse requires about
0.3 to 0.5 milliseconds to cross a synapse. This
time is required for release of neurotransmitter
from the axon terminal and excitation in the
dendron of the next neuron.
h. Synaptic fatigue - The transmission of nerve
impulse across the synapse halts temporarily
due to exhaustion of its neurotransmitter.
i. Velocity - The rate of transmission of impulse
is higher in long and thick nerves. It is higher
in homeotherms than in poikilotherms. The
velocity of transmission is higher in voluntary
fibres (100 - 120 m/second in man) as opposed
to autonomic or involuntary nerves (10-20 m/
second). Similarly it is faster in medullated

nerve, as the impulse has to jump from one node
of Ranvier to the next. At the synapse where the
neurons communicate with one another. The
neuron carrying an impulse to the synapse is
the pre-synaptic neuron. The neuron receiving
input at the synapse is the post synaptic neuron
or generator region (gland or muscle). A
synaptic cleft or a small intercellular space lies
in between two cells having a width about 2030 nm between them. .
The process by which the impulse from
the pre-synaptic neuron is conducted to the
post-synaptic neuron or cell is called synaptic
transmission. It is a one way process carried
out by neurotransmission.
2. Types of synapses
a. Electrical synapse : In this type of synapse
gap between the neighbouring neurons is
very narrow. The synapse between such
closed neurons is mechanical. The electrical
conductive link is formed between the pre and
post synaptic neurons. At the gap junction, the
two cells are within almost 3.8 nm distance
of each other. Transmission across the gap is
faster but depends on the connection located
at the gap junctions between the two neurons.
Electrical synapses are found in those places
of the body requiring fastest response as in the
defence reflexes. also they are bidirectional,
allowing transmission in either direction or
may be unidirectional.
b. Chemical synapse : These are specialized
junctions through which cells of the neural
system send chemical signal to the other
neurons and to non-neuronal cells, such as
gland and muscle. Synaptic gap is larger than
that in electrical synapse and it is 20-40 nm.
A chemical synapse between a motor neuron
and a muscle cell is called a neuromuscular
junction. There are three components of a
typical chemical synapse. 1. The presynaptic
terminal (mostly axonic terminal), 2. The
synaptic membrane of the post synaptic cell
(usually on the dendrite of the next neuron/

gland cell/ muscle) and 3. The post synaptic
neuron.
The impulse travels along the axon of the
pre-synaptic neuron to the axon terminal. Most
presynaptic neurons or axons have several
synaptic knobs at their ends or terminals. These
knobs have arrays of membranous sacs, called
synaptic vesicles, that contain neurotransmitter
molecules.
When an impulse reaches a synaptic
knob, voltage sensitive Ca++ channels open
and calcium (Ca++) diffuses inward from the
extracellular fluid.
The increased calcium concentration inside
the cells, initiates a series of events that fuse
the synaptic vesicles with the cell membrane
of presynaptic neuron, where they release their
neurotransmitters by exocytosis. Once the
neurotransmitters bind to the receptors of the
post-synaptic cell, the action is either excitatory
(turning a process on) or inhibitory (turning a
process off). This is dependent on the nature of
the neurotransmitter involved.
Once the impulse has been transferred across
the synapse, the enzyme like cholinesterase
destroys the neurotransmitter and the synapse
is ready to receive a new impulse.
9.5 Transmission of nerve impulse :
The neurons are cells with some specials
features. The cells can be excited. The
nerve impulse is a wave of bioelectrical or
electrochemical disturbances passing along a
neuron. The transmission of the nerve impulse
along the long nerve fibre/axon tube is a
result of electrical charges across the neuronal
membrane during conduction of an excitation.
Each neuron has a charged cellular membrane
with a voltage which is different on the outer
and inner side of the membrane. The plasma
membrane separates the outer and inner
solutions of different chemical compounds but
having approximately the same total number
of ions. The external tissue fluid has both Na+

187

and K+ but there is predominance of Na+ and
Cl-, while K+ is predominant within the fibre
or in the intracellular fluid. This condition of
a resting nerve is also called a polarised state
and it is established by maintaining an excess
of Na+ on the outerside. On the inside there is
an excess of K+ along with large negatively
charged protein molecules and nucleic acid.
Some amount of Na+ and K+ is always leaks
across the membrane. The Na+/K+ pump in the
membrane actively restores the ions to their
appropriate side. Against the concentration and
electrochemical gradient, Na+ is being forced
out and K+ is being forced inside the membrane.
This process is called sodium pump or Na-K
exchange pump. This active process requires
ATP energy. The difference in distribuiton of
Na+ and K+ on the two sides of the membrane
produces a potential difference of -50 to -100
millivolts (average is -70 millivolts).
This potential difference seen in a resting
nerve is thus called resting potential. (-70
millivolts) and it is mainly due to differential
permeability of the resting membrane which
is much more permeable to K+ than to Na+.
This results in slightly more K+ diffusing out
than Na+ moving inside and causing slight
difference in polarity. Also ions like negatively
charged proteins and nucleic acids inside the
cell make the overall charge negative on the
inside and positive charge on the outside.

Generation of nerve impulse :
1. Depolarization : The origin and maintenance
of resting potential depends on the original
perfect state. Any change or disturbance to
the membrane will cause Na+ to enter into the
membrane and lower the potential difference
(lesser than -70 millivolts). This makes the
membrane more permeable to Na+, so there will
be rapid influx of Na+. This property is peculiar
to a nerve membrane.
The voltage gated Na+/K+ channels
are special in 2 ways : They can change the
potential difference of the membrane as per the
stimulus received and also the gates operate
separately and are self closing.
During resting potential, both gates are
closed and resting potential is maintained.
However during depolarization the Na+
gates open but not the K+ gates. This causes
Na+ to rush into the axon and bring about a
depolarisation (opposite of polarity). Extra
cellular fluid (ECF) becomes electronegative
with respect to the inner membrane which
becomes electropositive. The value of action
potential is +30 millivolts to +60 millivolts.
This triggers depolarisation in the next part
while it itself starts going to repolarisation.

The nerve membrane not only has leakage
channels but also has many gated channels for
Na+/K+. These are also called voltage gated
channels. These channels enable the neuron
to change it membrane potential to active
potential in response to a stimuli. The Na+/K+
gated channels are separate so transport of
both these ions is separately done. However
during resting potential, both these gates are
closed and the membrane resting potential is
maintained.

2. Re-polarization : Change in the polarity
from depolarized, back to the original state is
done by the process of repolarization. It occurs
after a short interval called refractory period.
The large number of Na+ on the inside causes a
drop in the permeability of membrane to Na+
and at the same time making it more permeable
to K+ ions by opening the K+ voltage gates
and slowly closing the Na+ gates. This action
is a localized activity. K+ ions passes out very
rapidly as compared to slow entry of Na+.
In this period, Na+ gates are closed, K+
gates are open and Na+ - K+ pumps becomes
operational. This process of producing a wave
of stimulation → causing depolarization →
repolarization is repeated continuously upto the
end of axon terminal. It is a self propagating
process.
In medullated nerves, the insulating fatty
myelin sheath prevents flow of ions between
the axoplasm and ECF. The transport pump and
gated channels can operate only in the region
of nodes of Ranvier, where myelin sheath is
absent.
The action potential cannot travel as a
wave of membrane depolarization it has to
jump from node to node. This process called
saltatory conduction, is at the rate of 120
m/second. It is faster than the continuous
conduction in non-medulated fibre (50 :1).
Do you know ?
Na-K pump operates actively and by use
of carrier (for every 3 Na+ pumped out 2K+
are pumped in). It is electrogenic.
Always Remember
The resting potential of axon is -70
mV. Na+- K+ Pump pumps out 3 Na+ ions for
every 2 K+ ions they pump into the cell.

through a synapse?

impulse in the neuron.

Permeability of membrane changes and it

Na+ ions diffuse into the neuron from the ECF
Number of positive ions inside axon increases
Membrane potential changes from -70 mV to

Since the polarity has been reversed from
negative on outside and positive inside it is also
called depolarization (compared to ECF)
Repolarisation : At the peak of action potential
(+30 mv), the Na+ channels close. K+ gates open.

9.6 Human Nervous System :
The nervous system in humans is well
developed and complex. It is broadly classified
into three parts. viz, CNS, PNS and ANS.
1. Central nervous system (CNS) : The brain
and spinal cord are the parts of CNS which lie
along the mid dorsal axis. Brain is enclosed
within the brain box/cranium of the skull,
whereas the spinal cord occupies the vertebral
canal of the vertebral column. Inner to these
bony coverings, are three protective membranes
called meninges. That protect the brain and
spinal cord.
a. Dura mater : It is the outermost tough,
non vascular, thick and fibrous meninx and is
attached to the inner side of the cranium. It is
separated from the underlying arachnoid mater
by the subdural space, filled with a serous fluid.
b. Arachnoid mater : It is the middle, thin and
non vascular layer of connective tissue having
web like appearance. It is separated from the

189

oxygen to the brain. It protects the brain from
desiccation.

CSF is slightly alkaline fluid with a specific
gravity of 1.005. A total of 100 -120 cc of CSF

c. Pia mater : It is the innermost delicate,

with the CNS.
CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) : It is lymph like
extra cellular fluid secreted by choroid plexuses
of pia mater present inner to subarachnoid
space in the ventricles of the brain within
the central canal of spinal cord. The CSF is
secreted by the pia mater, the choroid plexuses
and the ependymal cells lining the ventricles of
the brain and central canal of spinal cord. The
three openings in the roof of medulla oblogata
help in draining out the CSF from brain to the
outside. The meninges and CSF act as a shock
absorber and protect the brain and spinal cord
from mechanical injuries. It also maintains
constant pressure inside cranium. It helps in
exchange of nutrients and wastes between
blood and brain tissue. It helps in the supply of

molecules from the blood to the brain tissue.
Endothelial cells lining the blood capillaries

Always Remember
CSF is continuously generated by the
ependymal cells lining the ventricles and
central canal and simultaneoulsy drained
out of the brain into the blood stream.
CSF maintains a constant pressure inside
the cranium. The nervous tissue is without
lympatic vessels.

killer on the nervous system.

band of nerve fibres called corpus callosum.
The outer surface of cerebrum is called
cerebral cortex while the deep inner part is
cerebral medulla. The cerebral cortex has
outer thin region composed of grey matter and
inner medulla composed of white matter.
The surface of each cerebral hemisphere
is greatly folded by many convolutions or
gyri and grooves called sulci. These greately
increase total surface area for accomodation of
the vast number of nerve cells.
Each cerebral hemisphere is further divided
into four main lobes by three deep sulci. These
are Centre sulcus which demarcates frontal lobe
from the parietal lobe.
Parieto-occipital sulcus separates the parietal
from occipital lobe.
The lateral or sylvian sulcus demarcates the
temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal
lobes
Since these three sulci are not complete,
the lobes are not clearly demarcated from each
other. A fifth median lobe called insula or
insular cortex is folded deep within the lateral
sulcus.
The grey matter of cerebral cortex
mainly consists of cell bodies of billions of
neurons along with non-medulated fibres and
dendrons. The white matter mainly has axons
of myelinated nerves.

Label the various parts of the digram
and recall their functions.

A. The Human brain :
The study of all aspects of the brain is
called encephalology. The brain can be divided
into three main parts - forebrain, midbrain and
hindbrain.
a. Forebrain : Forebrain consists of olfactory
lobes, cerebrum and diencephalon.
i. Olfactory lobes :
These are highly reduced in human brain
and covered by cerebrum from all sides except
ventral. Each lobe consists of a olfactory
peduncle and olfactory bulb.
ii. Cerebrum :
It is a largest part of the brain, making up
about 85 % of total brain. It is divided into right
and left cerebral hemisphere by means of a
deep median, long fissure. The two hemispheres

Corpus callosum is typically seen in
mammalian brain.
Corpus callosum is the largest commissure
of the brain.
It has an anterior and posterior fold called
genu and splenium respectively.
Why an injury to the right cerebrum
affects the functioning of the left side of body ?
Functional areas of cerebrum :
1. Frontal lobes : They have motor area
which controls voluntary motor activities or
movements of muscles. The premotor area
is higher centre for involuntary movements
and autonomus nervous system. Association
area is for coordination between sensation
and movements. Broca’s area/motor speech
area. It translates the thoughts into speech.
Expression of emotions, intelligence, willpower, memory, personality areas are located
in the frontal lobe.
2. Parietal lobes : They are mainly for
somaesthetic sensation of pain, pressure,
temperature, taste (gustatoreceptor).
3. Temporal lobes : It contains centres for
smell (olfactory), hearing (auditory), speech
and emotions.
4. Occipital lobes : They have visual area
mainly for sense of vision.

Area of contact between temporal, parietal
and occipital lobes is centre for Wernicke’s
area or intelligence centre. It helps in the
understanding of spoken and written words.
The cerebrum, thus shows all three types of
areas sensory, motor and association area.
Basal nuclei or basal ganglia are grey
masses present within the white matter or
lying on the lateral sides of thalamus. The
basal ganglia or nuclei of cerebrum receive
neurotransmitters from various parts. They
help the cortex in the execution of activities
at the subconscious level e.g. writing slow or
rapid typing. Corpus striatum at the floor of
cerebrum is the largest basal nucleus.
Curiosity Box:
• Find out how different functional areas of
the brain can be mapped ?
• What is EEG ? What information can be
obtained from the EEG ?
• Which are silent areas of the brain?
iii. Diencephalon :
It is the part of the forebrain that contains
the epithalamus, thalamus and hypothalamus.
It lies below the corpus callosum and above
the midbrain. It encloses a single cavity termed
third ventricle/Diocoel which communicates
with the two lateral ventricles of cerebrum
through a narrow opening called foramen of
Monro.

The epithalamus is the thin non nervous
roof of the diencephalon. Anterioly it is fused
with the piamater to form the anterior choroid
plexus and from its dorsal wall it is connected
to pineal gland through a pineal stalk. (Pineal
gland is discussed in detail in chemical coordination). Earlier this gland was though to be
vestigeal, but later it has been found to produce
to hormone melatonin (sleep inducing hormone;
also related to reproductive behaviour). The
lateral thick walls of diencephalon form the
thalami. They mainly contain grey matter. The
habenculor commissure connects two thalami.
Different parts of the brain are interconnected
by the RAS (Reticular Activating System)
through the thalami. It is called relay centre as
it transmitts all sensory impulses except those
of olfactory (smell) to the cerebrum (gatekeeper
of cerebrum connecting the anterior lateral
ventricle to the iter posteriorly. The narrow
cavity of diencephalon is called IIIrd ventricle
or diocoel. It connects anteriorly to the two
lateral ventricles by a single opening called
Foramen of Monroe and posteriorly to the IVth
ventricle or metacoel through a narrow duct
of Sylvius or iter.
Hypothalamus : It forms a floor of
the diencephalon. It is richly supplied with
blood vessels (Hypothalamo-hypophyseal
portal vein) helps in feed back mechanism for
hormonal control). It maintains homeostasis,
internal equilibrium of the body and

involuntary behaviour control. Like in the
cerebrum, the hypothalamus also contains
hypothalamic nuclei in its white matter (refer
fig. 9.33 pituitary gland) with neuro-secretory
cells involved in the production of hormones
oxytocin and vasopressin.
The hypothalamus is a link between the
nervous and the endocrine system. It has higher
centres for endocrine system. It regulates heart
rate, respiration, blood pressure (B.P.), body
temperature, water and electrolyte balance. It
has centres for hunger, thirst, sleep, fatique,
satiety centre, secretion of glands of stomach
and intestine. It also produces neurohormones
that stimulate the pituitary gland. A complex
neuronal circuit called the limbic system is
formed by the hypothalamus amygdala, parts
of epithalamus and thalamus, hippocampus
and other areas. It appears to be responsible
for emotional reactions, motivational drives
and memory. The floor of the hypothalamus
continues as a downward projection called
hypopyseal stalk or infundibulum which
connects it to the hypophysis (pituitary
gland) both physically and functionally by
secretion of neurotransmitters (details in
chemical coordination). The inferior surface
of hypothalamus also bears the optic chiasma
(crossing of the two optic nerves) and a pair of
mammillary bodies (unique to mammmalian
brain and responsible for recollective memory).

b. Mid brain :
It is located between diencephalon and the
pons varolli. It contains the cerebral aqueduct
or iter that connects the third and fourth
ventricles. The corpora quadrigemina are
four rounded elevations on the dorsal surface
of the mid brain. The two superior colliculi are
involved in visual reflexes and the two inferior
colliculi are relay centres for auditory reflexes
that operate when it is necessary to move the
head to hear sounds more distinctly.
The mid brain also contains on its inferior
surface two thick fibrous tracks called cerebral
peduncles or crura cerebri. These tracts of
ascending and descending nerve fibres from
RAS and connect the cerebrum mid brain. Near
the centre of the mid brain is a mass of grey
matter scattered within the white matter. It is
called the red nucleus. It plays an important
role in controlling posture and muscle tone,
modifying some motor activities and motor coordination.
Always Remember
Wernicke's area : It is the sensory
speech area responsible for understanding
and formulating written and spoken
language.
Broca's area : It is the motor speech
area and translates thoughts into speech
and controls movement of tongue, lips and
vocal cords.
c. Hind brain :
The posterior region of the brain is
called hind brain. It consists of pons varolli,
cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The pons
varolli appears as a rounded bulge on the
underside of the brain stem (brain stem consist
of mid brain, pons and medulla and continues
upto spinal cord), and contains a cross band of
nerve fibres connecting cerebrum, cerebellar
lobes, medulla oblongata and spinal cord. It
also contains several nuclei. The cerebellum is
the second largest part of the brain and consists
of two lateral hemispheres and a central vermis.
It is composed of white matter with a thin layer

of grey matter, the cortex. The white matter
intermixes with the grey matter and shows a
tree-like pattern called arbor vitae.
Can you tell?
Explain - ‘‘Cerebullum is well developed
in humans’’.
The surface of cerebellum shows
convolutions (gyri and sulci) a number of
nuclei lie deep within each lateral or cerebellar
hemisphere. Over 30 million neurons lie in
the cortex. Three pairs of myelinated nerve
bundles called cerebullar penduncles connect
cerebellum to the other parts of CNS. It is an
important centre which maintains equilibrium
of body, posture, balancing orientation,
moderation
of
voluntary
movements,
maintainance of muscle tone. It is a regulatory
centre for neuromuscular activities and controls
the rapid activities like walking, running,
speaking etc. All activitie of cerebellum are
involuntanry (though may involve learning in
early stages). The medulla oblongata is the
posterior conical part of the brain and continues
as the spinal cord. It has inner grey matter and
outer white matter. It controls involuntary vital
functions like heart beat, respiration, vasomotor
activities and peristalsis. It also controls nonvital reflex activities like coughing, sneezing,
swallowing, vomitting, yawning etc. The
cavity of medulla is called IVth ventricle or
metacoel. It’s roof has the posterior choroid
plexes for secretion of CSF. The posterior
choroid plexes also shows 3 openings - a pair
of lateral foramen of Luschka and a median
foramen of Magendie.

B. Spinal Cord :
Spinal cord is the part of central nervous
system and forms the lower extension of the
medulla oblongata of the brain. Like the brain,
it is covered and protected by bony covering
and membranes. It lies within the neural canal
of the vertebral column and is surrounded by
three meninges - dura mater, arachnoid mater
and pia mater. The Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF)
secreted by pia mater, forms a fluid cushion
around the spinal cord and within it inside the
central canal.
Externally, the spinal cord appears as long
cylindrical rod, 42 to 45 cm long and 2.0 to
2.5 cm broad. The spinal cord is broadest at
its anterior end gradually tapers into conus
medullaris (L1 to L2) and continues as a
thread like filum terminale end posteriorly.
Spinal cord shows two swellings along its
length called cervical and lumbar swelling.
31 pairs of spinal nerves arise from
lateral sides of the spinal cord. These nerves
are concentrated in the region of cervical
and lumbar swelling and around the conus
medullaris. The bunch of nerves in the hind
part of the spinal cord, along with the filum
terminale, appear like a horse’s tail, so called
cauda equina.
T. S. of spinal cord
The spinal cord is dorsoventrally flattened
due to the presence of deep, narrow posterior
fissure and shallow, broad anterior fissure. A
central canal can be seen in the centre. The
fissures divide the spinal cord incompletely
into a right and left side. The grey matter is
somewhat H-shaped or butterfly shaped and

is on the inner side, while the white matter is
on the outer side. The fissures divide the grey
matter into six horns, namely dorsal, lateral
and ventral horns, while the white matter is
divisible into 6 columns or funiculi, namely
dorsal, lateral and ventral funiculi. The dorsal
and ventral horns extend out of the spinal
cord as dorsal root and ventral root of spinal
cord respectively. Of these, the dorsal root is
connected to the dorsal root ganglion. (It lies
just outside and lateral to the spinal cord). It
has an aggregation/collection of unipolar
sensory neurons.

The association or inter-neurons lie inside
the grey matter. The receive signal from the
sensory nerve, integrate it and direct the
response towards motor neurons lying towards
the ventral horn. The lateral horns have
neurons of autonomic nervous system (ANS).
The nerves arising from these neurons, emerge
out from the ventral root of spinal nerve.
The white matter consists mainly of bundles
of myelinated nerve fibre called ascending and
descending tracts. The ascending tracts conduct
sensory impulses from spinal cord to the brain
and these lie in the dorsal column/funiculi.
The descending tracts conduct motor impulses
from brain to the lateral and ventral funiculi of
spinal cord.
Functions : The spinal cord is the main centre
for the most reflex actions. It provides pathway
for conduction of sensory and motor impulses
to and from the brain. It provides nervous
connection to many parts of the body.

195

2. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) : The
peripheral nervous system connects the central
nervous system to the different parts of the body
having receptors and effectors. Depending

on the connection to the CNS, the peripheral
nerves are classified into two main types Cranial nerves - connected to the brain.
Spinal nerves - connected to the spinal cord.

Cranial Nerves : These nerves develop from
the brain, in all amniotes (reptiles, birds and
mammals). There are 12 pairs of cranial
nerves. Roman numbering I to XII is used to
denote them. These nerves originate from or
terminate into the brain.
According to their function, these are
classified as sensory (I, II, VIII), motor (III,
IV, VI, XI, XII) and mixed (V, VII, IX, X)
nerves.
The details of cranial nerves present in the
human body is presented in Table 9.15.
Spinal Nerves : Thirty one pairs of spinal
nerves originate from the spinal cord. They
are mixed nerves and they provide two way
communication between the spinal cord and
part of the upper and lower limbs, neck and
trunk.

Formation of a typical spinal nerve : All
spinal nerves are of the mixed type i.e. they
have some nerve fibre as sensory and some
motor. Each spinal nerve is formed inside
the neural canal of verterbral column by two
roots - the posterior or dorsal sensory root and
anterior or ventral root. Anterior root receives
the sensory nerve from the dorsal root ganglion
(cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in the
ganglion), while the anterior/ventral root gives
out the motor nerve. The dorsal sensory and the
ventral motor nerves together form the mixed
spinal nerve. It emerges out from both sides
of the spinal cord through the intervertebral
foramen. As soon as it emerges out of vertebral
column, it shows three branches viz.

Ramus dorsalis : from skin and to muscles
of dorsal side
Ramus ventralis : the largest of the three
supplies the organs and muscles on lateral
and anterior side

three and given out from 1st thoracic upto
3rd lumbar (L3) spinal nerve. It joins the
sympathetic ganglia.

Reflex Action : It is a sudden, spontaneous
automatic, involuntary response to stimulus.
The response to stimulus is said to be
involuntary as it is carried out without any
conscious effort by the brain. The path along
which the action is carried out is called reflex
arc.
[Note : In your earlier classes you have studied
about the reflex actions.]
Human nervous system is divided into
CNS, PNS, ANS. PNS consist of network
of nerves arising from or going to the CNS.
Accordingly peripheral nerves are classified as
a. Afferent nerves
b. Efferent nerves
Afferent nerve fibres transmit sensory impulse
from tissue or organ to the CNS and the
efferent nerve fibres transmit regulatory or
motor impulses from the CNS to the various
peripheral tissues and organ.

Fig. 9.16 Autonomic Nervous System
However according to recent studies,
the extent of PNS has been broadened to
incorporate the ANS.
According to this view, the PNS is divided
into
i. somatic nervous system and
ii. autonomic nervous system
The somatic nerous system relays impulses
from CNS to the skeletal or voluntary muscles
of the body.
3. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) :
Autonomic nervous system transmits
impulses from CNS to the involuntary organs
and smooth muscles of the body.
ANS consists of a special set of peripheral
nerves that regulate the activities of involuntary
organs like cardiac muscles, smooth muscles,
glands etc. In this, impulses are conducted
from the Central Nervous system by an axon
that synapses with an autonomous ganglion.
It is preganglionic neuron. The second neuron
in this ganglionic pathway has an axon that
extends from the autonomic ganglion to an
effector organ and is known as postganglionic
neuron.
Autonomic nervous system consists of
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
system.

Mr. Sharma suffered from a stroke and
the right side of his body was paralysed.
However his response was normal for knee
jerk reflex with either leg. Explain how and
why ?
a. Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):
It is also called thoraco-lumbar outflow. It
originates in the thoracic and lumbar region of
spinal cord (T1 to L3) and consists of 22 pairs
of sympathetic ganglia which lie on a pair of
sympathetic cords on lateral sides of the spinal
cord.
The pre-ganglionic nerve fibres are short
and post ganglionic nerve fibres are long.
Adrenaline and Noradrenaline is produced
at the terminal ends of postganglionic nerve
fibres at the effector organ, hence it is also
called Adrenergic fibres. Sympathetic
nervous system controls body activities during
emergencies (fight or flight response). It has
excitatory and stimulating effect on most
organs of the body except in the digestive and
the excretory organ.

b. Parasympathetic Nervous System :
It is also called cranio-sacral outflow. It
consists of the branches from the cranial (III,
VII, IX, X) nerves, sacral (II, III) and spinal
(IV) nerves. It consists of ganglia which are
very close or within the wall of the effector
organs. The pre-ganglionic nerves are long
and post-ganglionic nerves are short. Acetylcholine is produced at the terminal end of postganglionic nerve at the effector organ, hence
these are also called cholinergic fibres.

defined by a type of stimuli that it can respond
to eg. a photoreceptor responds to light, what
exactly is the meaning of the receptor. It
implies that when a specific type of stimulus
reaches the sensory neuron (receptor) it causes
the production of an action potential in it and
this action potential is carried in the form of
an impulse. These impulses are conducted to
the different functional areas of the brain for
processing and interpretation.

Parasympathetic nervous system is
antagonistic to sympathetic nervous system. It
brings back to normal, all activities which are
stimulated by the sympathetic system. Hence
it is also called housekeeping system. It has an
inhibitory effect on most organs. However, the
activities like those associated with digestion,
peristalsis and micturition, which are inhibited
by sympathetic system are thus accelerated by
the parasympathetic system.

Eye :
The eyes are a pair of sensory organs of
vision. These are located in the orbit of skull
with a cushion of fat around them. Each eye
is spherical/rounded and called eyeball. The
eyes are protected bones, eyebrows, upper and
lower eyelids with eyelashes and the lacrimal/
tear glands. Movement of the eyeball within
the orbit is controlled by 6 sets of muscles.
Wall of the eyeball is made up of 3 layers
(1) sclera, (2) choroid and (3) retina
1. Sclera/scelrotic : It is the outermost layer
made of dense fibroelastic connetive tissue with
collagen fibres. It provides attachment to the
eyeball muscles. The anterior thick, transparent
part of sclera is cornea. It is slightly bulged out
for focussing light on the retina. The sclera
is provided with blood vessels, however the
cornea is devoid of them. Cornea is nourished
by aqueous humour and also by lacrimal
secretion. The exposed part of sclera and the
entire Cornea are covered by a transparent
membranous covering called conjuctiva. It
provides protection and lubrication to the
cornea.

the vascular part of choroid sharply bends
into the cavity of eyeball, forming a thin and
coloured partition called iris. It is perforated in
the middle by an aperture called pupil. Smooth
muscles of the iris help in regulating the size
of pupil depending on the intensity of light
entering the eyeball. The pigment in the iris
determines the colour of the eye.
Lens : It is a transparent, elastic, biconvex
structure. It is suspended in the eyeball by the
suspensory ligaments. The lens and suspensory
ligaments divide the cavity of the eyeball into
a small anterior aqueous chamber, filled with
a clear watery fluid aqueous humor and a
posterior large vitreous chamber, filled with a
jelly like vitreous humor. It maintains shape of
the eyeball and maintain pressure for keeping
the lens in position.
Iris

b. Ciliary body : It is a thick, muscular, ring
like structure at the junction of choroid and
iris. Its epithelium secretes aqueous humor.
Attached to the ciliary body are suspensory
ligaments which hold the lens. The ligaments
and muscles of the ciliary body help in the
adjustment of the size of lens.

lining the iris and ciliary body (b) sensory part
lining the choroid. It has an outer pigmented
part and an inner nervous part. The inner
nervous part is transparent and made of 3
layers (1) outer photosensitive layer made of
rod and cone cells. (2) middle layer of bipolar
nerve cells (3) inner layer of ganglion cells. The
nerve fibres from the basal end of the ganglion
cells collectively form the optic nerve.

The blind spot is an area diagonally
opposite to the lens. It is the area of retina from
where the optic nerve and blood vessels leave
the eyeball. There are no rod and cone cells in
this region. An area, lateral to the and above
the blind spot is called yellow area or macula
lutea. At its centre is a depression called lovea
centralis. It has maximum density of cone cells
and is the place of formation of sharpest vision.
The rod and cone cells lie deep in the retina,
so that light has to pass through the ganglion
and bipolar cells before reaching them.
Photo receptor cells : These are of two
types (a) Rod cells (b) cone cells.
They contain light sensitive proteins
termed as photopigments. The cones are
responsible for daylight (photopic) vision and
colour vision. While the rods function in dim
light (Scotopic) vision. The purple red protein
called rhodopsin is present in the rods which
is vitamin A derivative. The cones are of three
types, which contain their own characteristic
photo-pigments that respond to red, green
and blue lights. Various combinations of
these cones and their photopigments produce
sensation of different colours. The sensation of
white light is produced due to the simultaneous
equal stimulation of these three types of cones.

Generation of image :
The light rays from the object pass through
the conjunctiva, cornea through the pupil upon
the lens and is focused on the retina to form
an image. In the visual area of cerebrum, the
nerve impulses are analysed and the image
formed is recognized.

The Optic nerve consists of the fibres
arising from the base of ganglion cells. It leaves
the eye ball from the posterior side and carries
visual impulses from the retina to the brain.

203

Always Remember
Accomodation : The lens makes fine
adjustments to bring a sharp focus on retina.
The ability of the lens by which the light ray
from far and near objects is focused on the
retina is called accomodation power of the
lens.

is a delicate, membranous structure which
transmits the sound waves to the middle ear.
It is formed of connective tissues covered with
skin on the outside and mucous membrane on
the inside.

Activity :
Collect information about causes and
corrections for myopia, hypermetropia,
astigmatism, presbyopia, cataract, night
blindness.

The middle ear consists of chain of
three ear ossicles called Malleus (hammer),
Incus (anvil) and Stapes (stirrup-the smallest
bone). On receiving the vibrations from the
tympanic membrane, the ear ossicles amplify
the vibrations and transfer these to the cochlea.
A short eustachian tube connects the middle
ear to the pharynx. It equalises air pressure on
both sides of the ear drum.

The internal ear consists of the labyrinth
and vestibular apparatus. The labyrinth consists
of bony labyrinth and membranous labyrinth.
These are filled with perilymph and endolymph
respectively. The coiled portion of the labyrinth
is cochlea.

Ear :
The human ear is called stato-acoustic
organ and it has two functions - hearing and
body equilibrium. Anatomically the ear is
made up of three parts : the external ear, middle
ear and inner ear.
The external ear consists of ear pinna,
auditory canal and tympanic membrane. In
humans, the ear pinna is an immovable part,
supported by elastic cartilage structure. It leads
into an auditory canal. The pinna collects and
sends the sound waves into the auditory canal.
The auditory canal ends at the ear drum. It
transfers the sound waves to the ear drum.
There are very fine hair and wax secreting
sebaceous glands in the skin of pinna and

The cochlea contains fluid filled three
chambers separated by Reissner’s membrane
and basilar membrane. The upper chamber
towards vestibul is called scala vestibuli and
the bottom chamber scala tympani are filled
with perilymph. The middle chamber is the
scala media. It is filled with endolymph while
scala vestibuli and scala tymphnith are filled
with perilymph. The organ of Corti is a pea
sized structure located on basilar membrane
(floor of scala media).
The organ of corti has a sensory epithelium
over the basilar membrane. The sensory
epithelium is in contact with a gelatinous
tectorial membrane. The sensory cells have
sensory hair on their free end so also called
hair cell. In between the rows of hair cells are
present supporting cells.
Hair cells have long stiff microvilli called
stereocillia on their apical surfaces. Above
these stereocellia, is a jelly like membrane

Inner Ear and the mechanism of balance :
Besides the cochlea, the inner ear also has
the vestibular apparatus which is composed
of three semi-circular canals and the utriculo
saccular region with the otolith organ. All three
semi-circular canals lie in different planes
at right angle to each other. These canals are
filled with endolymph. The base of each of
the canal has an ampulla in which there is a
sensory spot called crista. The cristae help in
maintaining equilibrium. The vestibule has
two sensory spots-macula of saccule and utricle
the macula consist of hair cells and supporting
cells. Tips of the hair and cilium project into a
thick gelataneous sheath otolithic membrane.
Within this membrane minute particle otoliths
or otoconia are secreted. These are made of
CaCO3 and protein. The macula and crista
are the receptors sensitive to the position of
the head with respect to gravity. The three
semicircular canals are arranged such away
that the movement in any plane can be detected
by these cells and the balance and posture of
the body is maintained. Receptors for dynamic
balance lie in the cristae of ampullae while for

static/linear balance these are in the maculae
of utriculus and sacculus.
Mechanism of Hearing :
Pinna of the ear receives the sound
waves and directs them to eardrum. Eardrum
vibrates and these vibrations are amplified
and transmitted through the ear ossicles to
the endolymph inside cochlea. This generates,
wave in the endolymph. These waves induce
ripples in the basilar membrane. These
movements in the basilar membrane cause the
hair cells to press against tectorial membrane.
This generates nerve impulse in the afferent
neurons. Impulse is sent to the brain via the
auditory nerve. Auditory cortex of the brain
decodes the sound.

Alzheimer’s disease :
It is the most common form of dementia.
Its incidence increases with the age, showing
the loss of cognitive functioning -thinking,
remembering, reasoning and behavioral
abilities to such an extent that it interferes with
the persons daily life and activities. It occurs
due to loss of cholinergic and other neurons in
the CNS, accumulation of amyloid proteins.
There is no cure for Alzheimer’s, but treatment
slows down the progression of the disease and
may improve the quality of life.
CHEMICAL COORDINATION
The cells and organisams communicate
with each other through chemical signals. Also
they are broadly of four types as follows :
Autocrines : Cells release secretion to stimulate
itself.

9.8 Disorders of nervous system :
Psychological disorders :
Commonly called mental disorders, are a
wide range of conditions that affect the mood,
thinking or behaviour. These affect multiple
areas of life and create distress for the person
suffering from it. Some of the major categories
of psychological disorders are - Intellectual
disability (formerly known as mental
retardation), Autism spectrum disorder, bipolar
disorder, depression, anxiety disorder, ADHD
(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), and
stress related disorders.
Parkinson's disease :
Degeneration of dopamine-producing
neurons in the CNS causes Parkinson's disease.
Symptoms develop gradually over the years.
Symptoms are tremors, stiffness, difficulty in
walking, balance and co-ordination.

Endocrines : Cells release secretion to
stimulate distant cells.
Pheromones : Organs release secretions to
stimulate other organism.
Higher animals have complex body
organization. Due to this, in addition to the
nervous coordination, there is need of chemical
coordination. Chemical coordination is carried
out by secretions of ductless glands. This
chemical coordination system is also called the
endocrine system.
9.9 Endocrine system :
The endocrine system controls body
activities by means of chemical messengers
called hormones. Hormones are released
directly into the blood. The hormone is carried
all over the body via blood. However the
message is relayed only to the target organs
which are stimulated to carry out specific
process which include activities like growth
and development.

206

Chemical nature of hormones
I. Amines : These are simple amines.
Catecholamines secreted by adrenal
medulla, epinephrine and non-epinephrine
and melatonin from pineal gland. Some
are modified from the amino acids. e.g.,
Thyroxine.
II. Peptide hormones : These hormones
consist of long or short chains of amino
acids. e.g. Hormones of hypothalamus
oxytocin, ADH, GnRH.
III. Protein hormone : Insulin, glucagon
TSH, FSH, LTH, GH, relaxin.
IV. Fatty acid derivatives :- Prostaglandin
V. Steroid hormones : These hormones are
lipid soluble and derived from cholesterol
and other steroids. e.g. estrogen
testosterone, aldosterone. Action of these
hormones is concerned with long lasting
responses.
VI. Gas : NO (Nitric Oxide)

Properties of Hormones :
They act as chemical messengers and are
effective in very low concentration. Hormones
can function as regulators that inhibit or
stimulate or modify specific processess. Some
hormones interact with receptors present on
plasma membrane of target cells where as
some enter the necluses to interact with genes.
Hypersecretion or Hyposecretion of hormons
leads to various disorders.
These are metabolised after their function.
Thus cannot be reused. Hormone secretion is
regulated by positive or negative feedback
mechanism.
Mechanism of hormone action :
Hormones are released in a very small
quantity. They produce their effect on the target
organs cells by binding to hormone receptors.
The hormone receptors may be on the cell
membrane or may be intracellular. A hormone

Activity :
Identify the glands and state their functions.

207

hormone receptor complex is formed and this
leads to biochemical change in the target tissue.
A. Mode of hormone action through
membrane receptors :
Hormones like catecholamines, peptide
and polypeptide hormones are not lipid soluble.
Therefore they cannot enter their target cells
through plasma membrane.
These non steroid water soluble hormones
interact with surface receptor, which initiate
metabolic activity. Molecules of amino acid
derivatives, peptide hormones bind to specific
receptor molecules located on the plasma
membrane. The hormone receptor complex
causes the release of an enzyme adenylate
cyclase from the receptor site. This enzyme
forms cyclic AMP from ATP of the cell. cAMP
activates enzymatic actions. The hormone acts
as the first messenger and cAMP is the second
messenger. Other kind of second messengers
are Ca++, cGMP and IP3 (Inositol triphosphate).
Hormone (e.g., FSH)

Receptor

B. Mode of action through intracellular
receptors :
Steroid and thyroid hormones are lipid
soluble and easily pass through plasma
membrane of target cell into the cytoplasm.
In the cytoplasm, they bind to specific intra
cellular receptor proteins forming a hormonereceptor complex that enters the nucleus. In
the nucleus, the hormone receptor complex
binds to a specific regulatory site of DNA.
The activated genes transcribes mRNA which
directs protein synthesis and enzymes in the
cytoplasm. Action of lipid soluble hormones is
slower but long lasting.

9.13 Major endocrine glands :
A. Hypothalamus :
It is ectodermal in origin. It is located at
the floor of diencephalon. Major function of
hypothalamus is to maintain homeostasis.
It controls the secretory activity of pituitary
gland by the release and inhibiting
hormones. All hormones of hypothalamus
are peptide hormones. They are secreted by
the neurosecretory cells so they are called
neurohormones. The hormones secreted by
hypothalamus are : ADH, Oxytocin.

lying in the cleft between the anterior and
posterior lob.

1. Adrenocorticotropin
Releasing
Hormone : It stimulates the release of
ACTH by the anterior pituitary gland.
2. Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone : It
stimulates the release of TSH by anterior
pituitary gland.
3. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone
(GnRH) : It stimulates pituitary to secrete
gonadotropins.
4. Prolactin
Inhibiting
Hormone
(Prolactostatin) : It inhibits prolactin
release by anterior piturary gland.
5. Somatostatin : It inhibits the release of
growth hormone.
6. Somatotropin stimulates release of
growth hormone.
7. Gastrin Releasing Peptide (GRP) and
8. Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP)

Neurohypophysis is connected directly
to the hypothalamus by axon fibres.
Adenohypophysis and intermediate lobes
are connected to the hypothalamus through
hypophyseal portal system.
Hypophyseal portal system :
Various hormones secreted by
hypothalamus reach the pituitary gland
through the hypophyseal portal system. The
portal vein collects blood from various parts
of hypothalamus and opens into anterior lobe
of pituitary. From pituitary, the vein finally
carries the blood into the superior vena cava.
Supraoptic nucleus
(ADH)

B. Pituitary gland or hypophysis gland :
Paraventricular
nucleus
The pituitary gland is the smallest gland.
(oxytocin)
Pituitary gland is a pea sized reddish-grey
coloured gland. It controls almost all other
endocrine glands, hence earlier it was called
Optic
Median eminence
the master endocrine gland. It is located just chiasma
below the hypothalamus and is attached to it
Infundibulum
by a stalk called infundibulum or hypophyseal
Hypophyseal
Hypophyseal
stalk. Pituitary gland remains lodged in a bony
artery
portal vein
depression called sella turcica of the sphenoid
Pars
bone. Pituitary gland consists of two lobes intermedia
Pars nervosa of
neurohypophysis
called anterior lobe (Adenohypophysis) and Pars distalis of
posterior lobe (Neurohypophysis). Both the adenohypophysis
lobes develop from different parts of embryo.
Hypophyseal vein
Hence it has of dual origin.
Fig. 9.25 : Pituitary gland
Adenohypophysis is an outgrowth from the
roof of buccal cavity. This outgrowth is called
Rathke’s pouch. It grows upward towards
the brain. The neurohypophysis grows as a
downward extension of hypothalamus. The
two outgrowths together form the pituitary
gland. The connection of Rathke’s pouch with
pituitray gland is lost in embryo. Intermediate
lobe (Pars intermedia) is a small reduced part

Adenohypophysis: It is the larger lobe of
pituitary gland. It is a highly cellular and
vascular part of pituitary gland. It contains
various types of epitheloid secretory cells,
acidophils, basophils, chromatophores. It is
differentiated into three parts – pars distalis,
pars intermedia and pars tuberalis. .

209

The hormones of adenohypophysis are
as follows :
1. Somatotropin /Somatotropic Hormone /
STH / Growth hormone / GH :
This hormone stimulates growth and
development of all tissues by accelerating
protein synthesis and cell division. Highest
secretion the GH is seen till puberty and then
its secretion of becomes low. However, it is
continuously secreted through out life for repair
and replacement of body tissue or cells.
Improper secretion of growth hormone
produces various disorders. Hyposecretion
of growth hormone since childhood results in
stunted physical growth and condition is called
pituitary dwarfism.
Hypersecretion of growth hormone in
childhood causes Gigantism, a condition of
overgrowth. The individual attains abnormal
height. When the pituitary gland produces
excess growth hormone in middle aged adults,
it results in disproportionate growth causing
disfigurement and enlargement of bones of
nose, lower jaw, hands, fingers and feet. The
condition is called Acromegaly.
2. Thyrotropin / Thyroid stimulating
Hormone / TSH : Its primary action is to
stimulate the thyroid gland secretion of the
hormone thyroxine.
3. Adreno corticotropic hormone / ACTH
/ Adrenocorticotropin : It stimulates
adrenal cortex to produce and secrete its
hormones. It maintains functioning of
adrenal cortex.
4. Prolactin / Luteotropin / Mammotropin:
Prolactin is unique among pituitary
hormones as it is under predominant
inhibitory control from hypothalamus.
Prolactin activates growth of breasts during
pregnancy (mammotropin) and stimulates
the milk production and secretion of milk
(lactogenic) by mammary gland after child
birth.

Internet my friend
Collect the information about
Simmond’s disease and Gorilla rib.
5. Gonadotropin :
a. Follicle stimulating hormone/ FSH :
It stimulates growth of ovarian follicles
in the females, while in males, it is concerned
with the development of seminiferous tubules.
b. Leutinizing Hormone/ LH :
In female, the leutinizing hormone helps
in ovulation (discharge of ovum from graafian
follicle). FSH and LH are responsible for
stimulation of ovaries to produce oestrogen
while LH induces the ruptured follicles to
develop into corpus luteum and for production
of progesterone.
c. Interstitial cell stimulating hormone /
ICSH :
In males, it stimulates the testes to produce
the androgen called testosterone. Testosterone
is responsible for development of secondary
sexual characters.
Neurohypophysis: It is differentiated into
three parts, 1. Pars nervosa/ neural lobe 2.
Infundibulum 3. Median eminence.
The pars nervosa acts as storage area for
the secretions of hypothalamus. It stores and
releases oxytocin and vasopressin.
1. Oxytocin : It stimulates contraction of
uterus during parturition. It also stimulates
the contraction of mammary glands to initiate
ejection or release of milk. So is called birth
hormone or milk ejecting hormone.
2. Antiduretic Hormone (ADH)/ Vasopressin:
It stimulates the re-absorption of water in
distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of
uriniferous tubules of the kidneys. It decreases
loss of water by reducing the urine quantity.
It increases blood pressure by causing vaso
constriction.

210

Deficiency of ADH reduces water reabsorption and increases urine output. This
condition is called diabetes insipidus No
glucose is lost in the urine. Excessive micturition
causes excessive thirst. This condition is called
polydipsia.

C. Pineal gland : The pineal gland is given off
from the roof of diencephalon and is located
between the two cerebral hemispheres. The
pineal gland is sensitive to the biochemical
signals of light. It secretes a hormone called
melatonin also known as sleep hormone.
Melatonin is derived from tryptophan and
plays a very important role in the regulation
of Biological Clock (e.g. 24 hour diurnal
rhythm) of our body. It helps in maintaining the
normal rhythm of sleep-wake cycle and also
influences body temperature, metabolism and
reproductive cycles.

It is the largest endocrine gland. This
bilobed gland is situated in front of the trachea
just below the larynx. It is richly supplied with
blood vessels. The two lobes of thyroid gland
are connected a non-secretory band called
isthmus. The thyroid lobes are composed of
rounded follicles held together by interfollicular
connective tissue called stroma. The stroma
contains blood capillaries and small group of
parafollicular cell or ‘C’ cells (clear cells).
Thyroid follicles are composed of cuboidal
epithelium resting on a basement membrane
and is filled with a gelatinous colloid.

Thyroxine regulates the basal metabolic
rate of body. It also regulates metabolism
by stimulating protein synthesis and
promotes growth of body tissues. It helps
in thermoregulation by increasing heat
production. It increases action of neuro
transmitters- adrenaline and nor adrenaline. It
also supports the process of RBC production
and maintenance of water and electrolyte
balance. It also regulates reproductive cycles
in females.
Parafollicular cells or ‘C’ cells produce
calcitonin hormone, which regulates calcium
metabolism.

Thyroid follicles

Fig. 9.28 Thyroid gland
Thyroid gland is stimulated to secrete its
hormones by thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH). The two hormones secreted by
the follicular cells are Thyroxine/tetra
iodothyronine/ T4 (four atoms of iodine) and
Triiodothyronine or T3 (three atoms of iodine).
Thyroxine is synthesized by attaching iodine
to amino acid tyrosine by enzymatic action.
The amino acid tyrosine molecule binds to
iodine to produce Monoiodotyronine (T1) or
2 atoms of iodine to produce Diiodothyronine
(T2). T1 and T2 molecules bind end to end
to make colloidal mass inside the follicle.
They are further metabolised to prepare T3
and T4. Triidothyronine or T3 is also secreted
in small quantity. It is physiologically more
active. Thyroid gland is the only gland that
stores its hormones. T3 and T4 hormones are
stored before secretion and are regulated by
thyrotropin of pituitary gland by negative feed
back mechanism.

Disorders related to thyroid gland:
a. Hyperthyroidism :
It is caused by increase in the levels of
thyroid hormones. This increases metabolic
rate, sensitivity, sweating, flushing, rapid
respiration, bulging of eye balls, and affects
various physiological activities.

Fig. 9.29 Bulging eyeballs
Grave’s disease (Exopthalmic goitre) :
Hyperthyrodism in adults, is characterised by
protruding eyeballs, increased BMR and weight
loss. Increased BMR produces a range of effect
like increased heart beat, increased BP, higher

212

body temperature, nervousness, irritability,
tremor of fingers and bulging eyeballs.

b. Hypothyroidism : It is caused by deficiency
of thyroid hormones or removal of thyroid
gland (Thyroidectomy).

Why are African pygmies diminutive. Is
it due to lack of GH, thyroxine or absence of
thyroxine receptors on their cell surface?

Cretinism : Hyposecretion in infants leads to
cretinism. A cretin has reduced BMR and low
oxidation. They are short statured because
the skeleton fails to grow. They are mentally
retarded. They show dry skin, thick tongue,
prolonged neonatal jaundice, lethargy and
constipation. This can be treated by early
administration of thyroid hormones. The
cretin shows stunted physical growth delayed
puberity and mental retardation.

Calcitonin : It is secreted by the ‘C’ cells. It
regulates the concentration of calcium and
phosphorus in the blood. It is under feedback
control of plasma calcium concentration in
plasma. It is secreted when concentration
of calcium rises in the blood. It lowers
concentration of calcium and phosphorus in
the plasma by decreasing their release from the
bones and accelerating the uptake of calcium
and phosphorous by the bones.

Myxoedema : It is the deficiency of thyroid
hormones in adults. It is characterised by
a peculiar thickening and puffiness of skin
and subcutaneous tissue particularly of the
face and extremities. Patient lacks alertness,
intelligence. The patient suffers from slow heart
rate, low B.P., always feeling cold, low body
temperature and retarded sexual development.

E. Parathyroid gland :
Parathyroid gland is situated on the
posterior surface of the lobes of thyroid gland.
Parathyroids are four in number and named as
superior and inferior parathyroid glands. The
cells of parathyroid glands are arranged in a
compact mass.
The parathyroids secrete a peptide
hormone called parathormone (PTH). It is
also called Collip’s hormone. It regulates
calcium and phosphate balance between blood
and other tissues. Release of parathormone
increases blood calcium level. It draws calcium
from bones increases calcium absorption in the
digestive tract and reduces loss of calcium in
the urine. Secretion of parathormone is under
feedback control of blood calcium level.

Do you know ?
During pregnancy, hypothyroidism
causes
defective
development
and
maturation of growing baby.
Simple goitre : (Iodine deficiency goitre) Iodine
is needed for synthesis of thyroid hormone. If
there is deficiency of iodine in the diet, it causes
enlargement of thyroid gland leading to simple
goitre. This disease is common in hilly areas.
Addition of iodine to table salt prevents this
disease. Size of the thyroid gland is increased
but total output of thyroxine is decreased.

Concentration of calcium and phosphate
is maintained by parathormone and calcitonin.
These two hormones form an antagonistic pair
like insulin and glucagon.
Hyposecretion of parathormone lowers
concentration of calcium in the blood. This
increases excitability of nerves and muscles
causing muscle twitch and spasm. This is called
parathyroid tetany or hypocalcaemic tetany.
Hypersecretion of parathormone is responsible
for more absorption of calcium from bones
i.e., demineralization of bones resulting in
softening, bending and fracture of bone. This
is called osteoporosis. It is common in women
who have reached menopause.
Can you tell?
1. With the help of a suitable diagram
describe the structure of thyroid gland.
2. How does fall and rise in blood calcium

F.

Thymus gland :
Thymus gland is located in the upper
part of thorax on the dorsal side of the heart.
It is soft, pinkish, bilobed mass of lymphoid
tissue. It is a prominent gland at birth but gets
gradually atrophied in the adult, so it is called
temporary gland.

It secretes the hormone thymosin. It has an
important role in the development of immune
system by maturation of T-lymphocytes.
It also promotes production of antibodies
by providing humoral immunity.
G. Adrenal gland/Suprarenal gland :
Adrenal glands have dual origin from
mesoderm and ectoderm. They are located
on the upper border of each kidney. Adrenal
glands are small, conical yellowish glands and
show two distinct regions, outer cortex and
inner medulla.
1. Adrenal cortex :
Adrenal cortex is derived from embryonic
mesoderm. Adrenal cortex secretes many
hormones together called corticoids. It is
differentiated into three concentric regions.
a. Outer thin zona glomerulosa : It secretes
Mineralocorticods. They are released
for regulating sodium and potassium ion
concentration. They regulate salt-water
balance, blood volume and blood pressure.
Aldosterone (salt retaining hormone) is the
main mineralocorticoid. It balances Na-K
levels.

medulla

b. Middle thick zona fasciculata : It is
responsible for secretion of Glucocorticoids
like cortisol. It regulates metabolism of
carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Cortisol is
an important glucocorticoid. It is responsible
for increase in blood glucose level. It is also
immuno suppressive. It suppresses synthesis of
antibodies. So it is used in treatment of allergy.
It prepares animals to face emergencies in
nature.
c. Inner thin zona reticularis : It is
responsible for production of sex corticoids
(Gonadocorticoids). In males, they have
a role in development and maintenance of
external sex characters. Excess sex corticoids
in female causes adrenal virilism and hirsutism
(excess hair on face) while in males it causes
gynaecomastia i.e. enlarged breast. Androgens
and estradiols are the produced by the adrenal
cortex.
Disorders related to Adrenal cortex :
a. Hyposecretion of mineralocorticoids and
glucocorticoids is responsible for Addison’s
disease. Characteristic features of this disease
are low blood sugar, low Na+ and high K+
concentration in plasma, increased loss of
Na+ and water in urine. It leads to weight loss,
weakness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
b. Hyper secretion of glucocorticoids produces
Cushing’s disease. It leads to high blood sugar
level, excretion of glucose in urine, rise Na+ in
blood volume, high blood pressure, obesity and
wasting of limb muscles.
Adrenal medulla : It develops
from
ectoderm. It secretes two hormones
adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline
(norepinephrine). Adrenaline is also known as
emergency hormone, also called 3F hormone
– (fight, flight and fright). Noradrenaline
regulates the blood pressure under normal
condition. It also acts as vasoconstrictor.

H. Pancreas :
It develops from endoderm. It is both
exocrine (studied in Digestive System) and
endocrine gland. Endocrine cells of pancreas
form groups of cells called Islets of Langehans.
There are four kinds of cells in islets of
Langerhans which secrete hormones.
I. Alpha (a) cells (20%) secrete glucagon.
It stimulates liver for glucogenolysis to
increase blood glucose level.
II. Beta (b) cells (70%) secrete insulin.
It stimulates liver and muscles for
glycogenesis. This lowers blood glucose
level.
III. Delta (d) cell (5%) secrete somatostatin
which inhibits the secretion of glucagon
and insulin. It also decreases the gastric
secretions, motility and absorption in
digestive tract.
IV. PP cells or F cells (5%) secrete pancreatic
polypeptide (PP). It inhibits the release of
pancreatic juice.
Disorder related to pancreas :
Diabetes mellitus (Hyperglycemia)
This is the most common metabolic
endocrine disorder of pancreas. It leads to
increase in blood glucose level. This is due to
under activity of Beta cells, which results in
reduced secretion of insulin. In children, such a
condition is called insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus/ Type I (IDDM) The other form of
diabetes is Non insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus/ Type II (NIDDM). It is caused due
to failure of insulin to facilitate the movement
of glucose into cells. Reduced sensitivity to
insulin is called insulin resistance.

215

Can you tell?
1. Distinguish between glucocorticoids and
mineralcorticoids.
2. Name the hormones secreted by the
adrenal cortex and state their role.
3. Write a note on Islets of Langerhans.
4. Pancreas is both exocrine as well as
endocrine gland. Give reason.
In both disorders, blood glucose level
increases. Some of the glucose is excreted in
urine. It also causes excessive urination and
dehydration of body tissues. Degradation
of fats increases formation of ketone bodies
(ketosis). Administration of insulin lowers
blood glucose level.
I. Gonads :
Gonads are sex organs (the testes and the
ovaries).
i. Ovaries : They produce
1. Estrogen : These are secreted by developing
follicle. Estradiol is the main oestrogen. It is
responsible for secondary sexual characters
in female.
2. Progesterone : It is secreted by corpus
luteum of the ovary after ovulation. This
hormone is essential for thickening of
uterine endometrium, thus preparing the
uterus for implantation of fertilized ovum. It
is responsible for development of mammary
glands during pregnancy. It inhibits uterine
contractions during pregnancy.
3. Relaxin : It is secreted by the corpus luteum
of the ovary at the end of gestation period.
It relaxes the cervix of the pregnant female
and ligaments of pelvic girdle for easy birth
of young one.
4. Inhibin : It is secreted by the corpus
luteum. Inhibin inhibits the FSH and GnRH
production.

ii. Testes :
Testes secrete male sex hormones called
androgens such as testosterone.
Testosterone : It is secreted from interstitial
cells or Leydig cells by the influence of
luteinising hormone (LH). Rise in testosterone
level in blood above normal inhibits LH
secretion.
It is also responsible for appearance of
secondary sexual characters such as facial and
pubic hair, deepening of voice, broadening of
shoulders, male aggressiveness, etc. It also
helps in maintenance of testes.
J. Diffuse endocrine glands
Placenta :
It is the intimate connection between foetus
and uterine wall of the mother for physiological
exchange of the material. Placenta is a
temporary endocrine gland.
During pregnancy, placenta secretes
hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, hCG
(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) and human
placental progesterone. These hormones check
the contraction of uterine muscles and also
maintain the thickness of uterine endometrium
thus they help to maintain pregnancy.
Gastro intestinal tract :
Do you know ?
Presence of HCG in urine sample
indicates pregnancy.
In the gastrointestinal mucosa, certain cells
are endocrine in function. These cells produce
hormones which play vital role in digestive
processes and flow of digestive juices.
1. Gastrin : It stimulates gastric glands to
produce gastric juice.
2. Secretin : It is responsible for secretion of
pancreatic juice and bile from presence and
liver.
3. Cholecystokinin CCK/ Pancreozymin PZ
: This hormone stimulates the pancreas to

216

release its enzymes and also stimulates gall
bladder to release bile.
4. Entero-gastrone / Gastric inhibitory
peptide (GIP) : It slows gastric contractions
and inhibits the secretion of gastric juice.

Hormone therapy/ HT : Hormone therapy is
the use of hormones in medical treatment. HT is
applied in Pregnancy, Menopause, Osteoprosis,
Growth hormone deficiency, Insulin Resistance,
Cancer, etc.

Kidney : It produces renin, erythropoietin
and calcitriol (calcitriol is the active form of
vitamin cholecalciferol (D3)).
Heart : Atrial natriuretic hormone /ANF.
Increases sodium excretion by kidneys and
reduces blood pressure.

Can you tell?
1. Give significance of relaxin and inhibin.
2. Enlist hormones secreted by GI tract and
state their role.
3. Mention the role of heart and kidney in
hormone secretion.

Do you know ?
Chemicals that operate between members of the same species are social hormones or
pheromones. These are commonly also called sex attractants or external hormones.
A pheromone is a volatile substance produced and discharged by an organism, which
induces a physiological response in other organism of the same species. Pheromones are
produced by many species of insects. Some pheromones enhance the chance of mating between
the sexes. These are called signaling pheromones used to induce a behavioral response. Social
insects such as ants make use of signaling pheromones to locate food sources and warn of
danger.
Worker bees are females maintained in a sterile state by the pheromone called anti– queen
factor produced by queen. The factor spreads among the workers preventing maturation of
the ovaries of workers as long as the queen is present in the bee hive. Increase in colony size
results in dilution of pheromones and second queen may develop.

Human Health and Diseases

10

Can you recall?
1. Generally individuals are conscious about
their health. So define health.
2. Define infectious and non infectious
disease? Give their examples.
Health does not simply mean ‘absence of
disease’ or physical fitness. In fact, it is difficult
to aptly define health. According to the World
Health Organization, health is defined as the state
of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or
infirmity. In short, health is birth right of humans.
Health also reflects the metabolic and functional
efficiency of living organisms. Hygiene is a
science of rules of health. To achieve good
health, it is therefore, necessary that we have
hygienic balanced diet, clean drinking water,
personal and community hygiene, regular
physical exercise, knowledge about diseases
and their effect on body, proper disposal of
waste and control of vectors.
Everyday we are exposed to various foreign
bodies, including infectious agents like bacteria,
viruses, etc. Despite constant exposure to variety
of pathogens, most of us remain healthy. This is
due to fact that the human body has ability to
resist almost all type of these foreign bodies. The
system which protects us from various infectious
agents, is called immune system. Resistance
is the ability to prevent the damage or disease,
through our defense mechanism.
10.1 Immunity:
The term ‘immunity’ has traditionally
referred to as the resistance exhibited by the
host towards injury caused by pathogens and
their products. However, protection against
infectious diseases is only one of the many

consequences of immune response, which is
entirely concerned with the reaction of the body
against any foreign antigen.
Immunity is in fact the ‘‘freedom’’ or
‘‘exempt’’. The concept of immunity is
believed to be started by Edward Jenner in
England. He developed cowpox vaccine for
the protection against the attack of small pox
(virus). Immunology is a branch of science
which deals with the study of immune system,
immune responses to foreign substances and
their role in resisting infection by pathogens.
The most important characteristic of
immune system is that it distinguishes self
(body’s own cells) and non-self (foreign
molecules or invading cells). So, the immune
system differentiates between the body cells
and the invaders. Any foreign substance
invading body and capable of stimulating an
immune response, is called an antigen. The
protective chemicals produced by immune cells
in response to antigens are called antibodies.
A. Types of immunity:
There are two types of immunity as Innate
or Inborn (inherited) immunity and Acquired or
Adaptive immunity.
i. Innate immunity or Inborn immunity:
Innate immunity is the resistance to
infections that an individual possesses by virtue
of his or her genetic make-up. It is the natural
(inborn) defense system of the body. It is not
affected by prior contact with microorganisms
or immunization. It is nonspecific, when it
indicates a degree of resistance to infection
in general, or specific where resistance to a
particular pathogen is concerned. One form of
innate immunity comprises the various types of
barriers which prevent entry of foreign agents
into the body.

221

a. Epithelial surface :
The intact skin and mucous covering the
body, protect it considerably against invasion
by microorganism(s).
The healthy skin possesses bactericidal
activity due to the presence of high
concentrations of salt in drying sweat.
Sebaceous secretions and long chain of
fatty acids have bactericidal and fungicidal
properties. The mucosa of the respiratory tract
has several innate mechanisms of defense. The
nose prevents entry of microorganisms to a
large extent, the inhaled particles being arrested
through hair at or near the nasal orifices. Those
that pass beyond are held by mucus lining the
epithelium and are swept back to pharynx
where they tend to swallowed or coughed out.
The cough reflex is an important defence
mechanism of respiratory tract. The mouth is
constantly bathed in saliva which has inhibitory
effect on microorganisms. The acidity of
gastric secretions in the stomach destroys
microorganisms. The flushing action of urine
eliminates bacteria from the urethra. Spermine
and zinc present in semen are antibacterial.

pathogens activates the ‘Complement cascade’
to eliminate pathogens. The interferons are a
class of cytokines (soluble proteins) released
by virally cells infected with viruses and
certain white blood cells to stimulate other cells
to protect themselves from viral infection.
c. Cellular factors in innate immunity :
Natural defence against the invasion of
blood and tissues by microorganisms and
other foreign particles, is mediated to a large
extent by phagocytic cells which ingest and
destroy them. Phagocytic cells (discovered
by Metchnikoff in 1882) are grouped as
microphages and macrophages. They remove
foreign particles that enter the body. A class of
lymphocytes called Natural killer (NK) cells is
important in nonspecific defence against viral
infections and tumors.
d. Fever :
Increase in the body temperature following
the infection is a natural defense mechanism.
It helps to accelerate the physiological
processes to destroy the invading pathogens.
Fever stimulates the production of interferon
and helps in recovery from viral infections.
e. Acute phase proteins (APPs):
Infection on injury leads to a sudden
increase in concentration of certain plasma
proteins, collectively called acute phase
proteins. These include C Reactive Protein
(CRP), Mannose binding protein, Alpha-1acid glycoprotein, Serum Amyloid P, etc.
APPs are believed to enhance host resistance,
prevent tissue injury and promote repair of
inflammatory lesions.

Knowledge Enhancer:
The conjunctiva is freed of foreign
particles by the flushing action of lachrymal
secretions. Eyes become susceptible to
infection when lachrymal secretion is
absent. Tears contain the antibacterial
substance Lysozyme (Ist described by
A. Fleming). This is a thermolabile, low
molecular weight, basic protein which
acts as a muramidase. Lysozyme is active
only against some pathogenic Gram +ve
bacteria.
b. Antimicrobial substances in blood and
tissues:
The complement system contains more
than 30 serum proteins, circulating in the blood
in an inactive state. The presence of microbial

ii. Acquired immunity:
The resistance that an individual acquires
during life is known as “Acquired immunity”.
It is also known as Adaptive or Specific
immunity”. It involves the formation of
antibodies in the body, which neutralize the
antigens. Acquired or Adaptive immunity has
the following unique features.

222

a. Specificity: It can produce specific
antibody or T-lymphocyte against a
particular antigen/pathogen.
b. Diversity: It can recognize a vast variety
of diverse pathogens or foreign molecules.
c. Discrimination between self and nonself: It differentiates between own
body cells (self) and foreign (non-self)
molecules.

b. Passive immunity:
Passive immunity is acquired when readymade antibodies are received by the body cells.
i.e. Body cells do not take any active part in the
production of immunity. Passive immunity can
be acquired either naturally or artificially.
1. Natural Acquired Passive immunity:
Before birth maternal antibodies are
transferred from mother to foetus
through placenta. After birth, antibodies
are transferred from mother to infant
through colostrum (first milk of mother)
and continue throughout the period of
breast feeding. The antibodies received
by baby from mother remain in the
body for a short time. Therefore, natural
acquired passive immunity is short lived.

d. Memory: When the immune system
encounters a specific foreign agent for
the first time, it generates an immune
response and eliminates the invader. This
is called first encounter. The immune
system retains the memory of the first
encounter. As a result, a second encounter
with same pathogen brings about quicker
and stronger immune response.

2. Artificially
Acquired
Passive
immunity: This immunity is developed
by injecting previously prepared
antibodies using serum from humans or
animals. For e.g. Antibodies obtained
from hyper immunised horses are
injected to humans against rabies
pathogens. It is short lived.

Types of Acquired Immunity:
Acquired immunity is of two types Active
and Passive.
a. Active immunity:
It is the resistance developed by
individuals as a result of an antigenic stimulus.
It also known as “Adaptive immunity”. Active
immunity may be natural or artificial.
1. Natural Acquired Active immunity:
Immunity acquired due to infection is
called natural active immunity. It is
developed after entry of pathogens in
the body. It is long-lasting immunity. e.g.
person who has recovered from attack of
measles develops natural acquired active
immunity to measles, for the life time.
2. Artificial Acquired Active immunity:
It is the resistance induced by vaccines.
Vaccine is introduced into the body to
stimulate the formation of antibodies by
the immune system. e.g. Polio vaccine,
BCG vaccine etc. such immunity may be
temporary or permanent.

B. Cells of Immune System:
There are two main types of cells involved
in the working of Immune system. They are (a)
Lymphocytes and (b) Antigen Presenting cells.
a. Lymphocytes:
Lymphocytes are the main cells of the
immune system. They, like the other blood
corpuscles, arise from the stem cells, the
haemocytoblasts, present in liver of the foetus
and in the bone marrow in adult. Some of
them undergo differentiation in the gut –
associated bursal lymphoid tissues (Tonsils,
Peyer’s patches) and are called Bursal or
B-lymphocytes; others are differentiated in the
thymus gland and are termed as T-lymphocytes.
The mature lymphocytes pass into body fluids
(blood and lymph) and circulate in the body.

223

Many of them stay in the lymph nodes. The
B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes form
humoral or antibody-mediated immune system
(AMIS) and cell-mediated immune system
(CMIS) respectively. Both the immune systems
need antigens to come into action, but they
respond in different ways.
Mechanism of response of T-lymphocytes to
antigens: On coming in contact with an antigen,
a T-lymphocyte forms clones of T-cells which
are similar but they perform different functions.
The clone has four types of T-lymphocytes:
i.

Helper T-cells: Sensitized helper T-cells
produce lymphokines for performing
several types of functions like proliferation
of
other T-cells,
stimulation
of
B-lymphocytes, macrophages, etc.
ii. Killer T-cells or Cytotoxic T-cells: They
directly attack and destroy invading
microbes, infected body cells and cancer
cells. Killer T-cells bind to infected cell
and secrete perforins. Then perforins form
a hole in infected cell. It also releases
substances that kill the cell, hence the name
cytotoxic T-cell.
iii. Suppressor T-cells: These cells suppress
entire immune system against attack on the
own body cells.
iv. Memory T-cells: These are previously
sensitized cells which retain the
sensitization memory for long time in the
future.
Mechanism of action of B-lymphocytes to
antigens:
B–lymphocytes are sensitized directly
by both antigens as well as by helper T-cells.
Activated B-lymphocyte multiplies very fast
to produce clone of plasma cells and memory
B-cells. The plasma cells produce specialized
glycoproteins, called antibodies which are
circulated through body fluids (humor) like
blood and lymph. The antibody molecules may
bind to a cell membrane or they remain free.

The free antibodies have three main
functions:
i. Agglutination of particulate matter,
including bacteria and viruses. The
immobilized mass is then engulfed by
phagocytes.
ii. Opsonisation or coating of bacteria to
facilitate their subsequent phagocytosis by
macrophages.
iii. Neutralization of toxins released by
bacteria e.g. tetanus toxin.
Each antibody is specific for a particular
antigen.
b. Antigen Presenting cells:
Antigen presenting cells engulf invading
pathogens and process the antigens. Then
the processed antigens are presented on their
own surface. These cells are able to deliver
a stimulatory signal that is necessary for
activation of helper T-cell.

Which is kind of immunity provided
by vaccination?
Can you recall?
1. Why are vaccines considered as antigen

2. How are vaccines produced?
3. Who was Edward Jenner?
C. Vaccination :
Administration of vaccine (i.e.
inactivated pathogen or antigenic protection
of particular pathogen) to protect against a
particular pathogen, is called vaccination.
The body’s immune system helps to
protect against pathogens that cause infection.
It’s an efficient system, most of the time,. It
either keeps microorganisms out or tracks them
down and gets rid of them. However, some
pathogens can overwhelm the immune system.
When this happens, it can cause serious illness.
The pathogens most likely to cause problems,
are the ones the body doesn’t recognize.

224

Vaccination is a way to “teach” the immune
system as to how to recognize and eliminate
pathogenic organism. That way, body is always
prepared if you are ever exposed.
Vaccination is an important form of
primary prevention, that can protect people
from getting sick. Vaccination has allowed us
to control diseases like measles, polio, tetanus
and whooping cough that once threatened
many lives. It’s important that as many people
as possible get vaccinated. Vaccinations don’t
just protect individuals, when enough people
are vaccinated. It also helps to protect the
society.

Vaccinations are safe:
Vaccines are considered to be safe. They
are rigorously tested and go through many
rounds of study, examination, and research
before they are used for the general public.
Extensive research and evidence shows
that vaccines are safe their side effects are rare
and typically mild.

10.2 Structure of Antibody:
Antibodies are glycoproteins which are
highly specific to specific antigens. They
are also known as Immunoglobulins (Igs),
produced in response to antigenic stimulation.
Antibodies are produced by plasma cells which
in turn are formed by B–lymphocytes. The
mature plasma cells produce antibodies at an
extremely rapid rate i.e. about 2000 molecules
per second.

How does vaccination work?
Healthy immune system defends against
invaders. Immune system consists of several
types of cells. These cells defend against
harmful pathogens. However, they have to
recognize an invader. Vaccination teaches
the body to recognize new pathogens causing
diseases. It stimulates the body to make
antibodies against antigens of pathogens.
It also primes immune cells to remember
the types of antigens. This allows a faster
response to the pathogen in future.
Vaccines work by exposing you to a safe
version of pathogen. Vaccines may be in the
form of:
• A protein or sugar from the pathogen.
• A dead or inactivated form of a pathogen.
• A toxoid containing toxin produced by a
pathogen.
• A weakened (attenuated) pathogen.
When the body responds to the vaccine,
it builds an adaptive immune response. This
helps to equip the body to fight off an actual
infection.

Fig. 10.1 : Structure of antibody
225

Structure:
Antibody is a ‘Y’ shaped molecule. Each
immunoglobulin molecule is made up of four
polypeptide chains. There are two heavy or
H-chains and two light or L-chains. The
four polypeptide chains are held together by
disulfide bonds (-s-s-) to form a ‘Y’ shaped
structure. The region holding together arms
and stem of antibody, is termed as hinge. Each
chain of the antibody includes two distinct
regions, the variable region and the constant
region. Variable regions constitute the antigenbinding site (paratope). This part of antibody
recognizes and binds to the specific antigen to
form an antigen-antibody complex. Since most
antibodies carry two antigen binding sites, they
are said to be bivalent.

Formation of antigen-antibody complex:
Study of antigen-antibody interactions is
called serology. Each antibody is specific for a
particular antigen. Combining sites of antigen,
called antigenic determinants (epitopes) react

with the corresponding antigen binding sites
of antibodies called paratopes. The antigen
binding sites (paratopes) are located on
the variable regions of the antibody. Small
variations in the variable regions make each
antibody highly specific for a particular
antigen. The variable region enables the
antibody to recognize the specific antigen
and bind to specific antigen in a lock and key
manner forming an antigen-antibody complex.
Antigen on Blood Cells:
There are several known antigens on
the surface of human red blood cells. These
antigens give rise to different blood groups.
There are many genetically determined blood
groups system like ABO, Rh, Duffy, Kidd,
Lewis, P, MNS, Bombay blood group, etc.
ABO Blood Groups:
The A, B and O blood groups were
discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1900. Later
on, the blood group AB was discovered by
Landsteiner’s students Decastello and Sturli
in 1902. Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel
prize for his discovery of human blood groups.
He found two antigens or agglutinogens on
the surface of human red blood cells and
named them as antigen A and antigen B. He
also noticed the corresponding antibodies or
agglutinins in the serum called ‘a’ and ‘b’.

In ABO system, the blood groups are
determined by the presence or absence of
antigen A and antigen B, the blood group of
person is classified into four groups A, B, AB
and O.
Blood group A : Individuals, with blood group
‘A’ have the antigen A on the surface of their
red blood cells (RBCs) and antibody ‘b’ in their
plasma.
Blood group B : Individuals with blood group
‘B’ have the antigen B on the surface of their
RBCs and antibodies ‘a’ in their plasma.
Blood group AB : Individuals with blood
group ‘AB’ have both antigens A and B on the
surface of their RBCs and no antibodies in their
plasma.
Blood group O – Individuals with blood group
‘O’ lack both antigens A and B on the surface
of their RBCs and show presence of both ‘a’
and ‘b’ antibodies in their plasma.

Rh (D) antigen induces a strong
immunogenic response when introduced
into Rh-ve individuals. Rh blood group is an
important factor in blood transfusion and is
involved in haemolytic diseases of the newborn
(HDN), which is called erythroblastosis
foetalis (destruction of the erythrocytes of the
foetus). It occurs when an Rh -ve mother
conceives Rh+ve foetus.
The Rh +ve RBCs from the foetus may
enter the mother’s circulatory system during
child birth, causing her to produce anti-Rh
antibodies. As a result, subsequent Rh+ve
foetuses will be exposed to the anti-Rh
antibodies produced by mother, which result in
HDN. In order to prevent HDN, Rh -ve mother
is injected with the anti-Rh antibody during all
pregnancies carrying Rh +ve foetus.

Rh factor:
Rh is the most complex of the blood group
system. Rh –factor is an antigenic protein
present on the surface of the red blood cells in
the human beings. It was first discovered by
Landsteiner and Wiener (1940), on the surface
of RBCs of Rhesus monkey, so it is called Rhfactor (also called D antigen). Person having
Rh factor (D antigen) are called Rh positive
(Rh +ve) and those lacking D antigen are called
Rh negative (Rh -ve).

10.3 Common Human Diseases:
Disease is defined as condition of disturbed
or deranged functioning of one or more organs
or organ systems of the body, caused due to
infections, defective diet or heredity. All human
diseases can be broadly categorized into
congenital diseases and acquired diseases.
Congenital diseases are present from
birth; may be caused by genetic abnormality
or metabolic disorder. They may be permanent
and were practically incurable. However,
modern research has helped to cure some
inborn diseases through gene therapy, enzyme
replacement therapy, etc.
Acquired diseases develop after the birth
and can be subdivided into (a) Communicable or
infectious diseases or (b) Non- Communicable
or Non-infectious diseases.
The diseases which are transmitted from
infected person to another healthy person
either directly or indirectly, are known as
Communicable or Infectious diseases. Malaria
and other diseases which are to be studied in
this chapter, are examples of this type.

Many pathogens use another organism,
the ‘Vector’ to reach us. These vectors are
actually parasites which we regularly come
across. Parasite is an organism that lives in or
on the body of another organism and derives its
nutrition from that of host organism. Parasites
are two catagories viz. : 1. Ectoparasite E.g.
bedbug 2. Endoparasite. E.g. Plasmodium
is a protozoan endoparasite of the mosquito
(vector) and human beings.
A. Malaria :
It is a vector (mosquito) borne infectious
disease caused by protist - Plasmodium.
There are four species of Plasmodium as
P. vivax , P. ovale, P. malariae, P. falciparum.
Only P. falciparum causes serious illness while
others are rarely fatal. Based on the species,
there are 4 - types of malaria.
Signs and symptoms of malaria :Symptoms of malaria begin to appear
about 7 to 15 days after the bite of infective
mosquito.

• Initial symptom are fever, headache, and
chills, may be difficult to recognize as
malaria.
The diseases that cannot be transmitted
• Classical symptoms of malaria is cyclic

Mode of transmission :
Plasmodium is transmitted from one
person to other through an insect vector- female
Anopheles mosquito.
When infected female Anopheles sucks
the human blood, it may transfer sporozoites
to human circulation. Sporozoites reproduce
asexually through fission (schizogony) in the
liver cells or erythrocytes. The cells formed
are now called merozoites. The cells formed
within erythrocytes function as gametocytes
(gamogony). Besides, it forms gametocytes
within erythrocytes (gamogony).
Gametocytes if taken up by female
Anopheles, fertilization occurs in its gut.
Diploid zygote is formed which transforms into
oocyst. Oocyst forms large number of haploid
sporozoites through meiosis (sporogony).
Sporozoites migrate to salivary glands and are
ready to infect new human host.

Treatment of malaria includes Artemisinin
based combination therapies (ACTs). WHO
has recommended 5 different ACTs which
includes various combinations of artesunate,
sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, etc. In addition,
quinine is also used.

Diagnosis and Treatment :
Malaria can diagnosed by microscopic
study of blood smear. Besides, other rapid
diagnostic tests based on nucleic acid
amplification techniques are also used.

B. Amoebiasis :
• Amoebiasis is also known as Amoebic
dysentry. It’s a common infection of human
gastro-intestinal tract, which affects 15 %
population of India.

Prevention and Control :
1. Prevention of mosquito bite by using
mosquito nets and insect repellents.
2. Spraying insecticides and draining
stagnant water where mosquito lays eggs.
3. Mosquito larve can be controlled by using
Gambusia fresh water fish (biocontrol).
Always Remember
The time interval from the invasion of
a pathogen to the development of clinical
manifestations, is known as Incubation
period.

Signs and symptoms:
• Diarrhoea, flatulence, stool with mucus and
abdominal pains (cramps) are common.
• Passing of blood with stool is common in
severe cases.
• Hepatomegaly occurs if parasite enters the
liver. Liver develops amoebic liver abscess
accompanied with fever and pain in right
abdomen.
Mode of transmission :
• Faeco-oral route.
• Eating with dirty hands.
• Contaminated food and water.
Diagnosis and Treatment : Diagnosis of
amoebiasis is made through microscopic
examination of the stool sample.
Amoebiasis is treated by the use of
Metronidazole and Tinidazole which can
destroy the E. histolytica in the digestive tract
as well as other tissues.

Signs and symptoms :
• Gastro-intestinal discomfort accompanied
with vomiting and fever.
• Presence of live worms in feacal matter.
• Pulmonary disorders occur in some
patients. Pneumonitis (inflammation in
alveolar wall).
• Loss of apetite and weight loss.
• Eosinophilia (number of eosinophils is
increased).
Mode of transmission: Food and drinks
contaminated with the eggs of these worm is
the main mode of transmission. Eggs hatch
inside the intestine of the new host. The larvae
pass through various organs and settle as adults
in the digestive system.
Diagnosis and Treatment: Diagnosis can be
done by microscopic examination of the stool.
Anti-helminthic drugs like Piperazine,
Mebendazole, Levamisole, Pyrantel are
effective against Ascaris lumbricoides.

230

D. Filariasis/ Elephantiasis :
Filariasis is caused by thread like wormsnematodes. These nematode parasites are
transported from person to person via mosquito
bite. Filariasis can be divided into 3 subtypes
as 1) Lymphatic Filariasis, 2) Subcutaneous
Filariasis (e.g. Loa loa, Mansonella spp.) and
3) Serous (abdominal)cavity Filariasis (e.g.
Mansonella spp.).

Signs and symptoms :• Edema with thickening of skin and
underlying tissue.
• Wuchereria bancrofti affects the legs,
arms, breasts, scrotum, etc.
• In lymphatic filariasis, worms infect
lymphatic system and causes enlargement
of lymph vessels and nodes. This is
elephantiasis i.e. limbs are swollen like
legs of elephant.
• Lymphedema i.e. accumulation of lymh
fluid in tissue causing swelling.

Personal hygienic habits like washing hand
with water and soap after using toilet are
also important. Washing vegetables throughly
before cooking and avoiding raw vegetables is
important for prevention of ascariasis.

•

Hydrocele i.e. testis are enlarged due to
accumulation of lymphatic fluid in testis.

Mode of transmission : Wuchereria bancrofti
is transmitted to human body by female Culex
mosquito.
The larvae escape mosquito body and
arrive on the human skin. They penetrate
the skin, undergo two moultings before they
become adults and settle in the lymphatic
system. Incubation period can be as long as
8-16 months.
Diagnosis and Treatment : Use of diethyl
-carbamazine citrate twice a day for three
weeks and thereafter for five days every six
month is effective against filarial worms.
Prevention and Control : Avoid mosquito bite
by using mosquito nets and insect repellents.
Eradication of mosquitoes is essential for
control of filariasis.
E. Typhoid :
Typhoid is an acute infection of intestine.
It is caused by Salmonella typhi. It is Gram -ve
bacteria found in intestinal lumen of infected
preson. Pathogenicity is due to “O”- antigen,
a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present on surface
coat. Flagella contains “H”- antigen.
Signs and Symptoms :
• Prolonged fever as high as 1040F.
• General nausea, fatigue, headache.
• Abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea.
• Rose-coloured rash on skin.
• White coat on tongue, cough.
• Anorexia (loss of apetite).
• If not treated- breathlessness, irregular
heartbeats, haemorrhage.

Diagnosis and Treatment :- Widal test is used
for diagnosis of typhoid. Treatment of typhoid
involves surgical removal of gall bladder in
severe cases. Antibiotics like Chloromycetin is
helpful treatment.
For prevention of typhoid WHO
recommendes two vaccines as oral
(Ty21a vaccine) and injectable (Typhoid
polysaccharide vaccine) sold as- typhim vi and
typherix.
F. Pneumonia :
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition
of lungs or alveoli of lungs. It is caused by a
variety of pathogens which may be viruses like
influenza virus, adenovirus, para influenza
and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) or
bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae or
fungal pathogens e.g. Pneumocystis jirovecii
and Pneumocystis carinii. Pneumonia can also
be caused by chemical burns or physical injury
to lungs.
Signs and Symptoms :-

Mode of transmission :
• It is a food and water borne disease.
•

•

Insects like housefly and cockroaches
feeding on fecal matter, may transfer the
bacteria to food material.
Poor hygiene habits and poor sanitation
conditions are responsible for the spread
of typhoid.

•

Cough produces yellow or greenish
sputum or phlegm.

•

High fever.

•

Shortness of breath (Dyspnea).

•

Chest pain during deep breath or coughing.

•

Loss of appetite, fatigue, headaches,
vomiting, joint pains and muscle aches.

Mode of transmission : Pneumonia mostly
spreads by direct person to person contact.

232

It can also spread via droplets released by
infected person or even by using shared clothes
and utensils.
Diagnosis and Treatment :- Course of
treatment depends upon pathogen leading
to the disease. For bacterial pneumonia,
antibiotics like Benzyl penicillin, Ampicillin
and Chloramphenicol are effective.

Adenovirus

Legionella
pneumophila

Signs and Symptoms :
• Cough , sore throat, running nose and
fever.
• Nasal congestion, sneezing.
• Conjunctivitis (red eyes)
• Muscle rashes, fatigue, headache,
shivering and loss of appetite.
Prevention and Control :
• Staying away from person suffering from
common cold.
• Washing hands with soap and water.
• Use of handkerchief to cover the nose and
mouth during coughing and sneezing.
• Alcohol based hand sanitizer can also be
used.

G. Common Cold :
It is a viral infectious disease of upper
respiratory region. It is also known as
nasopharyngitis, acute viral rhinopharyngitis,
acute coryza or a cold .
It is caused by a group of viruses known as
Rhinoviruses and Coronaviruses.

H. Ring Worm (Dermatophytosis) :
It is fungal infection of skin. It is caused
by many fungal species belonging to the genera
Trichophyton and Microsporum. These fungi
feed on keratin in skin, hair and nails.
Signs and Symptoms :
• Infected skin shows enlarged, red ring
caused due to ringworm.
• Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on various
parts of the body. These red patches cause
intense itching.
• Infection to nails is termed as
onychomycosis, in which nails become
thick, discoloured and disfigured.
• Athlete’s foot is the fungal infection that
usually begins between the toes.
Mode of transmission :- Ringworm spreads by
sharing of clothes, comb of infected person, etc.
Close contact with infected person is another
mode of infection.
Diagnosis and Treatment: Diagnosis is by
physical examination and treatment uses drugs
like nystatin, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.

233

The fungus lives on
dead tissue of the skin

i.e. tumor. When tumor is malignant, it is
described as cancer and has ability to invade
other tissues.

Microscopic
ringworm

Cancer harms the body when cancerous
cells divide uncontrollably to form new lumps
or masses of tissue called neoplasm (except
in the case of leukemia). Tumors can grow
and interfere with the normal functioning of
various organs. They also release secretions
which alter body function(s).

Prevention and Control :
Avoid close contact, sharing of clothes,
sport equipments. Washing clothes in hot water
with fungicidal soap help to destroy fungal
pathogen.
I. Dengue :
Dengue fever is a painful, debilitating
vector borne disease, caused by any one of four
closely related dengue viruses. Dengue virus is
transmitted through the bite of female Aedes
mosquito. The mosquito takes up the dengue
virus when it sucks blood of a person suffering
from dengue. It can not spread directly from
one person to another person.
Can you tell?
1. Which are the diseases that can be
avoided by eradication of mosquitoes in
your area?
2. What are the various ways in which
mosquitoes can be eradicated from any
area?
3. What precautions will you take if you
are travelling in an area which has lot of
mosquitoes?

It is one of the main killer diseases
nowadays. Physicians and researchers who
specialize in the study, diagnosis, treatment and
prevention of cancer are called oncologists.
Tumors may develop anywhere in the
body. However, all tumors are not cancerous.
There are two types of tumors: benign or
nonmalignant and cancerous or malignant.
1. Benign or Nonmalignant Tumor :
It grows slowly, may attain quite a large
size, but it remains restricted to the site of its
origin (localized) and does not spread to other
part of the body. This does not necessarily mean
that the benign tumors are not troublesome.
Some benign tumors are harmful and fatal
e.g. brain tumor (A brain tumor may cause
death because the brain is squeezed against the
hard skull). Moreover, the benign tumors may
sometimes become malignant. e.g. Adenoma
and Fibroid.
2. Malignant tumor or cancer :
The growth rate of this tumor is rapid and
mortality rate is comparatively more than
benign tumor. Rapid growth of tumors causes
overcrowding and disruption of normal cells.
The cancerous cells compete with the normal
cells for nutrients and finally kill them.

J. Cancer:
Abnormal, uncontrolled and purposeless
division of cells may lead to the formation/
development of mass of undifferentiated cells

These cells are spread from one organ to
other via blood or lymph and form new tumors
called secondary tumors. This migratory
process is called metastasis.

a. Types of Cancer:
There are five main types of cancers
according to the type of tissue affected. Cancers
are named according to the tissue from which
they arise.
i. Carcinoma: Cancer that arise from
epithelial tissue covering or lining the
body organs is known as carcinoma. It
include breast cancer, lung cancer, cancer
of stomach, skin cancer. etc.
ii. Sarcoma: Cancer that arises from
connective tissue is called sarcoma. It
include bone tumors (osteosarcoma),
muscle tumors (myosarcoma), cancer of
cartilage (chondrosarcoma) and cancer
of adipose tissue (liposarcoma).

v. Adenocarcinoma:
Adenocarcinoma
cancer arises in thyroid, pituitary adrenal
and other glandular tissues.

Collect information about different
types of lymphoma and hereditary cancer
syndromes.
b. Causes of Cancer:
Although, it is still not very clear as to how
the cancer is caused, several factors are now
known to be cancer- causing i.e. carcinogenic.
These factors are as follows.

iii. Lymphoma: Cancer that arises from
lymphatic tissue, is called lymphoma. It
occurs in the lymphatic nodes, spleen and
tissues of immune system.
iv. Leukemia: It is a type of blood cancer
in which there is excessive formation of
white blood cells (WBCs) or leucocytes
in the bone marrow. People suffering
from leukemia have very high leucocyte
count. The blood contains millions of
abnormal immature WBCs or leucocytes
that are incapable of fighting infections.
There are various types of leukemia such
as monocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic
leukemia etc.
235

i. Chemicals : Several chemicals are known
to induce cancer. These include nicotine,
caffeine, products of combustion of coal
and oil. Several polycyclic hydrocarbons,
some sex hormone and steroids, if
given or secreted in large amounts, may
cause cancer. Breast cancer seems to
have hormonal relationship. It is more
commonly observed in women who avoid
breast feeding.
ii. Radiation : The x-rays, gamma-rays
cosmic rays, ultra-violet rays etc. are
carcinogenic. Incidence of skin cancer is
higher in the people working in very sunny
areas due to UV radiation in the sunlight.
iii. Viruses : Viruses causing cancer have
genes called viral oncogenes (v-onc genes).

These viruses are also called oncogenic
viruses. e.g. EBV(Epstein-barr virus), HPV
(Human papiloma virus) etc.
iv. Oncogenes : Several genes called
cellular oncogenes (c-onc genes) or
proto-oncogenes have been identified in
normal cells which when activated under
certain condition could lead to oncogenic
transformation of cells.
v. Addiction : Different types addictions
likes smoking, chewing of tobacco lead to
cancer of mouth, lips and lungs. Alcohol
consumption may result in cancer of
oesophagus, stomach, intestine and liver.
Drugs also cause cancer e.g. Marijuana,
anaerobic steroids etc.

c. Treatment of Cancer:
Cancer treatment consists of combination
of a number of therapies which are follows:
i.

Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy comprises
administration of certain anticancer drugs.
The anticancer drugs check cell division
by inhibiting DNA synthesis or are more
toxic to cancerous cell than to normal
cells. Chemotherapy may lead to hair loss
or anaemia but both get corrected after the
treatment is stopped.

ii. Radiotherapy: It is used in addition to
chemotherapy. In radiotherapy, the basic
principle is to bombard the cancerous tissue
or cells with the rays from radioactive
materials. For treatment, the cancer tissue
or cells are exposed to radiations from
radioactive materials such as cobalt,
iridium and iodine. The rays x-rays
gamma rays and charge particles are used
to destroy the cancerous tissue or cells but
cause minimum damage to the surrounding
normal tissue or cells.
iii. Surgery: In surgery, the entire cancerous
tissue or cells are removed surgically. It
has limited utility. In certain cases such as
breast tumor or uterine tumor, the surgery
is most effective, but other treatments are
also given to kill any cancerous cell that
may have been escaped in surgery.
iv. Immunotherapy: Tumor cell have been
shown to avoid detection and destruction
by immune system. Therefore, the patients
are given substances called biological
response modifiers such as α-interferon
which activates their immune system and
helps in destroying the tumor.
v. Supportive therapy: Supportive therapy
is used to treat symptoms of cancer and
side effects of cancer treatments. Objective
of this therapy is to improve the quality of
life of cancer patient. This therapy varies
depending upon condition of individual
patient.

Over the matrix protein layers there is
an additional layer of lipids. Impregnated
with glycoprotein GP120 and GP 41
(Refer Fig. 10.14). The virus replicates in
actively dividing T4 lymphocytes and can
remain in a latent state/stage in the lymphoid
cells. The virus has unique ability to destroy
human T4 lymphocytes .
HIV is found in greatest concentration in
blood, semen and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
and to lesser extent in tears, milk, urine, saliva,
cervical and vaginal secretions.

The Tata Memorial Hospital is
situated at Khargar (Mumbai), Maharashtra
in India. It is a special cancer treatment and
research centre, closely associated with the
Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research
and Education in Cancer. It is recognized as
one of the leading cancer centres in South
Asia. It is an autonomous body funded and
controlled by Department of Atomic Energy,
Government of India which also oversees the
administration of Institute since 1962.

K. AIDS :
AIDS, the acquired immuno deficiency
syndrome, is a usually fatal illness caused
by a retrovirus (ss RNA) known as the
human immuno deficiency virus (HIV)
which weakens the body’s immune system,
leaving the victim vulnerable to life –threating
opportunistic infections, neurological disorders
and unusual malignancies. AIDS can be called
a modern pandemic (world wide), affecting
both industrialized and developing countries.
AIDS was first noticed in USA in 1981.
In India, first confirmed case of AIDS was in
April 1986 from Tamil Nadu.
Structure of HIV:
HIV is 100 to 140 nm in diameter. It
is spherical. Virus particle shows centrally
located two ss RNA molecules along with
reverse transcriptase enzymes. It is covered
by two layers of proteins. The outer layer is
of matrix protein (p17) while in inner layer is
capsid protein (p24).

Fig. 10.14 : Structure of HIV
The virus can be transmitted through :
1. Unsafe sexual contact: Including oral,
vaginal and anal sex.
2. Blood : Via blood transfusions or needle
sharing.
3. From mother to child (Transplacental):
A pregnant woman can transmit the virus
to her foetus through their shared blood
circulation, or a nursing mother can
transmit it to her baby from her breast
milk.
Other methods of spreading of the virus
are rare and include accidental needle injury,
artificial insemination with infected donated
semen and transplantation with infected organs.
AIDS virus has been found in urine, tears,
saliva, breast milk and vaginal secretions but
it seems not to be transmitted by these fluids
unless it gets into injuries.

237

Preventive measures:
AIDS has no cure, hence prevention is
the best choice. The following steps help in
preventing this dreadful disease-

Always Remember
HIV infection is not spread by:
Causal contact such as hugging, insect
bite (mosquitoes), participation in sports,
touching items previously touched by a
person infected with the virus, hand shake,
sharing clothes, swimming pools etc.
Clinical manifestations:
The clinical manifestations (symptoms)
of AIDS have been classified into four broad
categories.
i.
Initial infection with the virus and
formation of antibodies, usually 2-8
weeks after initial infection.
ii. Asymptomatic carrier state in which
no signs of disease, are seen. Incubation
period ranges for 6 months to 10 years.
iii. AIDS related complex (ARC) with one
or more of the following clinical signs:
recurrent fever for longer than one
month, fatigue, unexplained diarrhea,
night sweats, shortness of breath, loss of
more than 10 per cent body weight, etc.
iv. AIDS is the end stage of HIV infection.
It is characterised by life threatening
opportunistic infections (like pneumonia,
tuberculosis, kaposi sarcoma, etc.).

i.

People, particularly those in high –risk
group, should be educated about HIV
transmission.

ii.

Disposable needles and syringes should
be used and disposed off properly and
immidiately.

iii. Sexual habits

Every year, December 1st is observed as World AIDS Day.
India started a National AIDS control Programme in 1987.
“A red ribbon” is worn on World AIDS Day as a universal symbol
of awareness and support for people living with HIV.
• In India, 4 AIDS reference centers have been established1. AIIMS – New Delhi.
2. National Institute of Virology, Pune.
3. Center of advanced research on Virology, Vellore.
4. National institute of communicable diseases, New Delhi.
• National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) was set up in year 1992 by the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare. The aim of this organization is to prevent further transmission
of HIV, to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and to minimize
the socio-economic impact resulting from HIV infection.
238

Laboratory diagnosis:
At first a test is used to detect the HIV
antibodies, while a second confirmatory test
is used to weed out any false positive results.
The first test is ELISA (Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay). The confirmatory test,
usually a Western Blot, is a highly specific
test. It is based on detecting specific antibody
to viral core protein and envelope glycoprotein.
Treatment of AIDS :
Although AIDS has no cure, certain
medicines called as Antiretroviral drugs can
help in reducing the viral load and prolong the
life of HIV patient. Examples of these drugs
used in Antiretroviral therapy (ART) are TDF
(tenofovir), EFV(Efavirenz), Lamivudine
(3TC), etc.
The advancements made in biological
sciences have helped us to deal effectively with
many infectious diseases. The use of vaccines
and immunization programmes have enabled
us to eradicate completely the dreadful diseases
like small pox. A large number of other infectious
diseases like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and
tetanus have been controlled to a large extent
by the use of vaccines. Biotechnology is on
the verge of making available newer and safer
vaccines. Discovery of antibiotics and various
drugs has also enabled us to treat effectively
infectious diseases like tuberculosis.
10.4 Adolescence :
It is the period of begining with the
appearance of secondary sexual characters
and the termination with ceassation of somatic
i.e. body growth. It can also be regarded as
a transitional stage of physical and mental
development of child occurring between
puberty and the legal adulthood between 10 to
19 years of age where individual is no loger a
child but not yet an adult.

development on many fronts like sexual and
reproductive maturity, mental development,
adult identity and transition from socioeconomic and emotional dependant to relative
independence.
Stages of Adolescence :
Adolescents are defined are individual 10 to
19 year age group. The government of India in
its National youth policy defines adolescents
as 13-19 years. Adolescents is divided in three
stage viz. early stage, middle stage and late
stage.
i. Early period (10 to 14 years) :
The changes include begining of the
appearance of secondary sexual characters
; growth reaches to its peak; rapid physical
growth; concrete thinking; defining boundries
of dependence/independence; self exploration;
developing body image; development of intense
friendship; seeking to counter instability and
evaluation.
ii. Middle period (15 to 17 years) :
It is characterized by almost complete full
development of secondary sexual characteristic;
growth slows down, approximately 95 % of
the adult stature is attained; thinking is more
abstract; concrete thinking under stressful
conditions; reestablishing of body image
capable of long range thinking; sense of
leadership and all powerfulness; preoccupied
with romantic fantacy; ability testing to
attract opposite sex, peer group help defining
behavioral code etc.
iii. Late period (18 to 19 years) :
It is characterized by establishment of total
physical maturity established abstract thinking,
intellectual and functional identity; peer group
recedes in favor of individual relationship,
stable relationship and change from childhood
to adulthood relationship.

Adolescence in fact is a phase rather than
fixed time period in the life. It is a phase of
239

Physical changes of adolescence :
• Growth spurt occurs in both boys and
girls. In boys muscles develop, skin
become oily, broadening of shoulders
cracking of voice, development of
underarm and chest hair, pubic hair, facial
hair, enlargement of penis and testis. In
girls development of breast, widening of
hip, development of underarm and pubic
hair, enlargement of uterus and ovaries.
• Sexual development : Sex organs mature
and enlarge, sexual desire, errection
of penis in boys, sperm production,
ejaculation, ovulation, menstruation and
initiation of sexual behaviour.
• Emotional and social changes : This
include establishing own identity, fantacy,
day dreaming, attention seeking behavior,
emotional instability full of energy, sexual
attraction. Rapid mood changes conflicts
with family, behavioural code (influence
by peer group) self exploration and
evaluation, formation of new relationship,
peer pressure etc.

•

Avoid looking at your parents as the
enemy. Try to understand that your
parents are human beings, with their own
needs and feelings.
Listen to your parents with an open mind,
and try to see their point of view.
Share your feelings with your parents so
that they can understand you better.
Live up to your responsibilities at home
and in school so that your parents will
be more inclined to grant you the kind of
independence you want and need.
Bolster your criticisms of family, school
and government with suggestions for
practical improvements.
Be as courteous and considerate to your
own parents as you would be to the
parents of your friends.

Mental Health and Adolesence:
Many of the emotional and social changes
have implication on the mental health. Most of
the mental health issues that people confront
as adults begin to appear in adolesence . The
mental health implication includes confusion
irritation, moodiness, frustration, nausea, less
concentration, hyper activities, anger, effects
on life styles like obesity, addictions, accidents,
leading to ill health etc. The mental illness in
fact is in terms of different forms of depression
like insomnia and loss of energy.
Thus, mental illness (disorders or
unfavourable changes) is associated with
psychological or behaviour manifestation.
These are broadly classified as either psychoses
or neuroses. Psychoses include delusions,
hallucinations, distrubance in the thinking
process, etc. The psychoses lead to Alzheimer’s
disease schizophrenia, depressive psychosis,
etc. Amnesia (loss of memory) Bullimia
(extreme over indulgence in food) Anxiety (fear
or appretension) Anorexia nervosa (emotional
aversion to food) depression (sadness, inactivity
reduced to enjoy life, etc.) Neuroses include
schizophrenia, illusions, hallucination, etc.
Adolescence is thus characterized by
number of cognitive, emotional, behavioural,
physical and attitudinal changes which may
lead to positive personality development
depending upon the relation with parents or to
other conditions, to conflicts to others side. In
fact they view their friends peer group more
important and influential than their parents.
This may lead to various kinds of addictions
like smoking, taking drugs, etc.
Treatment :
Treatment of such disorders should be
preferentially
with
non-pharmacological
approch with due respect to rights of children.
WHO has recommended evidence based
guidelines under mental health Gap Action
Programme (mhGAP).

10.5 Addiction :

This is a complex condition characterised
by compulsive use of substance despite of
its harmful consequences. Addiction may
involve the use of substances (drugs) such
as alcohol, opioids, cocaine, nicotine and
others or behaviours such as gambling.
There is scientific evidence that the
addictive behaviours share key neurobiological
features. They intensely involve brain
pathways of reward and reinforcement,
affecting motivation, which involve the
neurotransmitter dopamine. It is important
to know that the neurological changes are
reversible after the substance-use or behaviour
is discontinued.
Addiction overall result in the impairment
of physical, physiological and psychological
functions of the body.

disappointments and failures as a part
of life. Channelize the energy of child
in sports, studies and other constructive
activities.
10.6 Drugs Abuse :
Surveys and statistics show that use
of drugs and alcohol has been on the rise
especially among the youth. This is really a
cause of concern as it could result in many
harmful effects. Proper education and guidance
would enable youth to safeguard themselves
against these dangerous behaviour pattern and
follow healthy lifestyle. The drugs, which are
commonly abused, are opioids, cannabinoids
and alkaloids of coca.
a. Opioids :
These drugs binds to opioid receptors
present in central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Heroin, otherwise called
smack is chemically di-acetyl morphine. It is
extracted from latex of poppy plant Papaver
somniferum. Heroin is depressent and slows
down the activity of body.
b. Cannabinoids :

•

Poorly defined rules.

•

Family conflicts.

•

Favorable parental attitudes towards
alcohol and drug uses.

•

Expectations from drugs use.

Interact with receptors present in brain.
Inhalation and ingestion of these substances
affect the cardiovascular system. These are
obtained from inflorescences and the parts of
Cannabis sativa. Marijuana, hashish, charas
and ganja are other different forms of drugs
obtained from this plant.

•

Risk taking behavior.

c. Cocain :

Methods /measures to control drug abuse :1. Always remember ‘Prevention is better
than cure’.
2. Avoid undue pressure – A child should
not be forced to perform beyond his /her
capacities in studies, sports and other
activities.
3. Education and Counselling of child
to face problems and stress, to accept

This is an alkaloid obtained from coca
plant- Erythroxylum coca. It increases level
of neurotransmitter-dopamine. Its excessive
dosage causes extreme happiness, irritability,
paranoia.
Hallucinogens (mind expanding drugs) :
These are alkaloids causing day-dreaming.
Lycergic acid and cannabis are hallucinogenic
substances. Atropa bellodona and Datura

241

spp. also have hallucinogenic properterties.
Hallucination are unreal perceptions of unreal
object due to the disorder of nervous system.
Do you know ?
Drugs like barbiturates, amphetamine,
benzo-diazepins, lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD) are derived from plant Cannabis sativa
are used as a medicine. It help the patient in
contracting insomnia and depression.
Addiction and Dependence :
Because of the perceived benefits,
drugs are used repeatedly. The most important
thing, which one fails to realize, is the inherent
addictive nature of alcohol and drugs. Addiction
is a psychological attachment to certain effects
–such as euphoria and a temporary feeling of
well-being –associated with drugs and alcohol.
These drive people to take them even when
these are not needed, or even when their use
becomes self-destructive. With repeated use
of drugs, the tolerance level of the receptors
present in our body increases.
Consequently the receptors respond
only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading
to greater intake and addiction. However, it
should be clearly borne in mind that use of
these drugs even once, can lead to addiction. In
the absence of any guidance or counselling, the
person gets addicted and becomes dependent
on their use. Dependence is the tendency of
the body to manifest a characteristic and
unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular
dose of drugs/ alcohol is abruptly discontinued.
This is characterized by anxiety, trembling,
nausea and sweating, which may be relieved
when use is resumed.
Effects of Drug/ Alcohol Abuse :
The immediate adverse effects of drugs
and alcohol abuse are manifested in the form
of reckless behaviour, vandalism and violence.

Excessive doses of drugs may lead to coma and
death due to respiratory failure, heart failure or
cerebral hemorrhage. A combination of drugs
or their intake along with alcohol generally
results in overdose and even deaths.
The most common warning signs of drug
and alcohol abuse among youth include drop in
academic performance, unexplained absence
from school/college, lack of interest in personal
hygiene, withdrawal, isolation, depression,
fatigue, aggressive and rebellious behaviour,
deteriorating relationships with family and
friends, loss of interest in hobbies, change in
sleeping and eating habits, fluctuations in
weight, appetite, etc.
There may even be some far-reaching
implications of drug/alcohol abuse. If an
abuser is unable to get money to buy drugs/
alcohol he/she may turn to crime. At times,
a drug/alcohol addict becomes the cause of
mental and financial distress to his/her entire
family and friends.
Those who take drugs intravenously (direct
injection into the vein using a needle and
syringe) are likely to acquire serious infections
like HIV and hepatitis B. Use of alcohol during
adolescence may also have long-term effects
like loss balance, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis. It
could lead to heavy drinking in adulthood.
Chronic use of drugs and alcohol damages
nervous system and liver (cirrhosis). Use of
drugs and alcohol during pregnancy adversely
affects the foetus.
Another misuse of drugs is that certain
sports persons use drugs to enhance
performance. They (mis)use narcotic
analgesics, anabolic steroids, diuretics and
certain hormones to increase muscle strength
and bulk and to promote aggressiveness and
overall improvement in their performance.
Side-effects of the use of anabolic steroids
in females include masculinization (features
like males), increased aggressiveness, mood

242

swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycles,
excessive hair growth on the face and body,
enlargement of clitoris, deepening of voice.
In males it includes acne, increased
aggressiveness, mood swings, depression, and
reduction of size of the testicles, decreased
sperm production, kidney and liver dysfunction,
breast enlargement, premature baldness,
enlargement of the prostate gland. These effects
may be permanent with prolonged use.

Prevention and Control :
The age-old adage (i.e. proverb) is
‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true for
all addictions. It is also true that habits such as
smoking, taking drug or alcohol are more likely
to be taken up at a young age, more during
adolescence. It is best to identify the situations
that push an adolescent towards use of drugs
or alcohol, and to take remedial measures well
in time. In this regard, the parents and the
teachers have a special responsibility.

Enhancement of Food Production
Do you know ?

Can you recall?

Primary aim of plant breeding is
to obtain a new crop veriety superior to
the existing type, in all characters. This
purposeful manipulation incorporates various
objectives. which differ form plant to plant
depending upon its type and the use. Some
objectives are common- like yield, quality,
resistance, life cycle span, etc., while some
objectives will differ on the basis of the type
and use of plant.

1. What are hybrid plants?
2. Different examples of microbes used in
household production.
3. The types or groups of micro-organism
that produce antibiotics.
4. What are biofertilizers?
5. What is the source of silk thread?
11.1 Improvement In Food Production :
Food is one of the basic needs as it gives us
energy for everything. It keeps us alive, strong
and healthy. It can be defined as any thing solid
or liquid, which when swallowed, digested and
assimilated in the body, keeping us well. It is
organic, energy rich, non-poisonous, edible and
nourishing substance.
Green plants synthesize their own food
through photosynthesis. But animals including
humans can not synthesize their food on their
own, hence are dependent on plants directly.
The famine is responsible for dearth of
food, besides the rapid and dramatic increase
in world population over the time. To meet
the increasing demand for food, there is need
for improvement of food production, both
quantity wise and quality wise (nutritive).
Plant breeding and animal breeding help us
to increase the food production.
11.2 Plant breeding :
The
improvement
or
purposeful
manipulation in the heredity of crops and the
production of new superior varieties of existing
crop plants, constitute what is called plant
breeding. It is, therefore, an applied branch
of botany. It is infact an art and the science
of changing and improving the heredity of
plants. Plant breeding can be carried out by
using the applications of principles of genetics,
taxonomy, physiology, pathology, agriculture,
rDNA technology, etc.

Plant breeding is a method of altering
the genetic pattern of plants to increase their
value and utility for human welfare. The plant
breeding is done to increase crop yield, improve
quality, increase tolerance to environmental
stresses, make the plants resistant to pathogens
and increase tolerance to insect pest. Green
Revolution was the result of a sequence of
scientific breakthroughs and developmental
activities that successfully fought hunger
by increasing food production. Seeds with
superior quality, use of chemicals - pesticides
and fertilizers, and multiple cropping system
supported by the use of modern farm machinery
and proper irrigation system, helped for the
development of high-yielding and disease
resistant varieties in wheat, rice, maize, etc.
In fact, plant breeding dates back to about
10,000 years ago. The present day crops are the
result of domestication and acclimatization.

Different methods of plant breeding
include Introduction, Selection, Hybridization,
Mutation breeding, Polyploidy breeding,
Molecular plant breeding, Tissue culture,
rDNA technology, SCP, etc.

called wide/ distant crosses. Interspecific and
intergeneric hybrids are seldom to occur in the
nature.
The main steps of the plant breeding
program (Hybridization) are as follows :

Know the Scientist :
Dr. Norman E. Borlaug:
An American biologist, who has been
called “Father of the Green Revolution”,
“Agriculture’s greatest spokesperson” and
“The Man Who Saved a Billion Lives.
Dr. Borlaug, a 1970 Nobel Laureate,
was honoured for his work in the ‘Green
Revolution,’ saving millions of lives from
famine in India, Mexico, and the Middle
East.
Dr. M. S. Swaminathan:
He has been called the “Father of Green
Revolution in India” for his role in introducing
and further developing high-yielding
varieties of wheat in India. He advocated
moving India to sustainable development,
especially using environmentally sustainable
agriculture, sustainable food security and the
preservation of biodiversity. He is pioneer in
mutation breeding in India. He developed
new varieties of wheat like sonora, NP 165
and sarbati.

1. Collection of Variability :
Wild species and relatives of the cultivated
species having desired traits, should be collected
and preserved. The entire collection having
all the diverse alleles (i.e. variations) for all
genes in a given crop, is called germplasm
collection. Variations are useful in the selection.
Germplasm conservation can be done in
following ways• In situ conservation : It can be done with
the help of forests and Natural Reserves.
• Ex situ conservation : It is done through
botanical gardens, seed banks, etc.

A. Hybridization and its technique :
It is the cheif method that offers greater
possibilities in the crop improvement than
other methods. The use of this method is the
only effective means of combining together the
desirable characters of two or more varieties.
By this method, one can create new genetic
combinations of already existing characters
and new genetic variations. It also exploits and
utilizes hybrid-vigour.
Internet my friend
Try to know more about the hybrid-vigour.
Hybridization can be intravarietal,
intervarietal (between two varieties of the same
species), interspecific (between two species
of the same genus) and intergeneric (between
two genera of the same family). As parental
plants are distantly related, such crosses are also

2. Evaluation and Selection of Parents :
It is an important and essential step. The
collected germplasm is evaluated (screened)
to identify plants with desirable characters.
The selected parents must be healthy, vigorous
and should show desirable but complementary
features. The selected parents are selfed for
three to four generations to make them pure
or homozygous. It is made sure that only pure
lines are selected, multiplied and used in the
hybridization.
3. Hybridization :
The variety showing maximum desirable
features is selected as female (recurrent) parent
and the other one as male parent (donor) which
lacks good characters found in recurrent parent.
The pollen grains from anthers of male
parent are collected and then artificially dusted
over stigmas of emasculated flowers of female
parent. Pollination is followed by seed and fruit
formation in due course. The seed, thus obtained
represents the hybrid generation.
The hybrid F1 progeny is selected and
evaluated forthe desired combinations of
characters.

performance is recorded. The selected lines
are then grown for three generations at least in
natural field, in different agroclimatic zones.
Finally variety is released as new variety for use
by the farmers.
Many high yielding, hybrid varieties of rice,
wheat, sugarcane, millets, developed through
hybridization, have helped farmer community
to attain record agricultural production in India
since 1961. This is called green revolution.
Indian Hybrid Crops :

1. Wheat and Rice :
In 1960s, wheat and rice production
increased
tremendously.
Norman
E.
Borlaug developed semi-dwarf varieties of
wheat. Sonalika and Kalyan Sona are two of
the hybrid wheat varieties, grown in India.
Semi-dwarf rice varieties were taken from
IR−8 (International Rice Research Institute)
and Taichung native−I (from Taiwan) and
introduced in India. Jaya, Padma and Ratna are
the better-yielding, semi-dwarf rice varieties that
were developed later.

4. Selection and Testing of Superior
Recombinants :
The F1 hybrid plants showing superiority
over both the parents and having high hybridvigour, are selected. Such hybrids are then selfed
for few generations to make them homozygous
for the said desirable characters till there is a
state of uniformity, so that the characters will not
segeregate further.
5. Testing, Release and Commercialization of
New Cultivars :
The newly selected lines are evaluated
for the productivity and other features like
disease resistance, pest resistance, quality, etc.
Initially, these plants are grown under controlled
conditions of water, fertilizers, etc. and their

2. Sugarcane :
• Saccharum barberi is a native of North
India and S. officinarum belongs to South
India.
• S. officinarum has thicker stem and high
sugar contents, but it does not grow well in
North India.
• These two varieties were crossed to get
the desirable qualities of both (high sugar
content, thicker stem and the ability to grow
in North India). CO -419, 421, 453 are high
yielding and having high sugar contents
are developed in India at Coimbatore
(Tamilnadu).
3. Millets :
• Hybrid maize (Ganga-3), Jowar (CO-12),
and Bajra (Niphad) have been successfully
developed in India.
• These varieties are high yielding and
resistant to water stress.

The basic objective of breeding for disease
resistance is to develop inherent quality in the
plant to prevent the pathogen from causing
the disease. Such varieties of plants are called
disease resistant plants. The basic technique used
is the same as for normal hybridization process.
Some disease resistant plants developed are :

B. Mutation Breeding :
Mutation is sudden heritable change in
the genotype, caused naturally. It can also be
induced by application of chemical mutagens.
Natural (physical) mutagens are : High temperature, high concentration of CO2, X rays,
UV rays.
Chemical mutagens are : Nitrous acid, EMS
(Ethyl- Methyl- Sulphonate), Mustard gas,
Colchicine, etc.
Seedlings or seeds are irradiated by CO60, exposed to UV bulbs, X ray machines, etc.
Mutagens cause gene mutations and
chromosomal aberrations. The treated
seedlings are then screened for resistance to
diseases/ pests, high yield, etc. e.g. Jagannath

Plant Breeding for Developing a Resistance
to Insect Pest:
Insects being herbivores, incur heavy loss in
the quantity and quality of crops. Resistance in
crops can be developed by following ways :
• Development of morphological characters
like hairy leaves in cotton and wheat
develop vector resistance from jassids and
cereal leaf beetle, respectively.
• Solid stem in wheat leads to resistance to
stem borers.
• Biochemical characters provide resistance
to insects and pests. For example, the high
aspartic acid, and low nitrogen and sugar
content in maize, lead to resistance against
stem borers.
• The nectar-less cotton having smooth leaves
develop resistance against bollworms.
Some pest-resistant varieties areCrop

11.3 Tissue culture :
It is actually a collection of different
techniques. It is infact, emerged as a technique
of plant biotechnology. Here, isolated cells,
tissues, organs are grown ‘in vitro’ on a solid/
liquid nutrient medium, under aseptic and
controlled conditions of light, humidity and
tempreature, for achieving different objectives.
The part of plant used in tissue culture is called
explant.
Plant tissue culture is based on principle
of Totipotency which is an inherent ability of
living plant cell to grow, divide, redivide and
give rise to a whole plant. Haberlandt (1902)

249

for the first time conceived this idea and
developed the concept of in vitro cell culture
(plant morphogenesis).
The plant tissue culture medium contains all
essential minerals, sources for carbohydrates,
proteins and fats, water, growth hormones,
vitamins and agar (for callus culture). The
most commonly preferred medium for tissue
culture is MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium.
Based on the nature of explant : There are
three types viz, cell culture, organ culture and
embryo culture.
Based on the type of in vitro growth : There
are two tyes viz. Callus culture (solid medium)
and Suspension culture (liquid medium).
Maintenance of aseptic conditions :
Aseptic condition is essential so as to avoid
contamination by other harmful microorganisms. It is accomplished by sterilization
of : glass ware (use of detergents, hot air
oven), nutrient medium (by autoclave under
constant pressure of 15 lb/sq inch for continous
20 minutes), Explant (by treatment of 20%
ethyl alcohol and 0.1% HgCl2), Inoculation
chamber (Laminar air flow) - by using UV
ray tube for 1 hour before performing actual
inoculation of explant on the sterilized nutrient
medium.

Other conditions maintained are :
Temperature - 180C to 200C, pH of nutrient
medium 5 to 5.8 and aeration particularly for
suspension culture.
In callus culture the solid medium is used.
The development and organisation of tissue
is lost. Hence, the cells of explant, divide and
redivide to form a mass of undifferentiated cells,
called callus. It is maintained on solid medium.
Callus can be induced to form organs like root
(rhizogenesis) and shoot (caulogenesis) and
thus the plantlet. No shaker (agitator) is needed.
In suspension culture small groups of
cells or a single cell are used as explant in the
liquid medium. The liquid medium is constantly
agitated by using shakers (agitators) so that
there is constant mixing of medium and the
explant.
Both the callus and suspension cultures die
in due course of time. Therefore, subculturing
is neccessary for continuation of the technique.
Micropropagation (Clonal Propagation) :
Organogenesis via shoots is considered
as one of the most widely used commercial
method of regeneration of plant.
Micropropagation is also known as
clonal propagation. It is the only process
adopted by Indian plant biotechnologists in

Advantages of microporpagation:
Do you know ?
Applications of tissue culture :
There are various application of tissue culture
in forestry, agriculture, horticulture, genetic
enginearing, physiology, etc. The different
applications of tissue culture include Production of disease free plants and haploid
plantlets, micropropagation, production of
secondary metabolites, protoplast culture,
culture of rare plants, somaclonal variations
production of stress resistant plants, etc.
different industries, mainly for the commercial
production of ornamental plants like orchids,
Chrysanthemum, Eucalyptus, etc. and fruit
plants like banana, grapes, Citrus, etc.

1. It helps in rapid multiplication of plants.
2. A large number of plantlets are obtained
within a short period and from a small
space.
3. Plants are obtained throughout the year
under controlled conditions, independent
of seasons.
4. Genetically similar plants (clones) are
produced (formed) by this method.
Therefore desirable characters (genotype)
and desired sex of superior variety are
kept constant for many generations.
5. The rare plant and endangered species
are multiplied by this method and such
plants are saved.

Selection and preparation of nutrient medium- MS medium with known concentrations and
proportions of different components.
Sterilization of medium in an autoclave for continuous 20 minutes under constant pressure
of 15/ lb/ inch2.
Preparation of plant material (explant) includes isolation of explant followed by surface
sterilization and rinsing with water. Explant is obtained from the growing stock plant.
Inoculation of the explant in the culture flask containing sterilized nutrient medium.
Inoculation is done in the laminar air flow cabinet unit.
Incubation of the inoculated explant. Here cells of explant grow, proliferate to form callus,
within 2-3 weeks.
Sub culturing of the callus (if callus is to be maintained for longer period, callus is divided
into 3-4 segments and then transferred to fresh culture medium).
Organogenesis - Initiation of rooting and shooting, that eventually leads to plantlet
formation.

we are able to obtain new variety in short
time span.
Do you know ?
High yielding varities of Banana viz.
‘Shrimati’, ‘Basarai’ and G- 9 are mostly
used in Maharashtra.
11.4 Single cell protein (SCP) :
By 2050, the world would need to produce
1,250 million tonnes of meat and dairy products
per year, to meet global demand for animalderived protein at current consumption levels.
However, growing demand for protein will
not be met sustainably by increasing meat and
dairy production because of the low efficiency
of converting feed to meat and dairy products.
More over, human population in
underdeveloped and even in the developing
countries is suffereing from protein malnutrition,
resulting into variety of nutritional diseases.
To fight with this, efforts are undertaken by
conventional methods to increase the food yield
by different methods of crop improvement,
use of biofertilizers, biopesticides, chemical
fertilizers and high yielding varieties (green
revolution). The efforts in other direction are
also undertaken in nonconventional way.
One such way is production of SCP- single
cell proteins. Improtance of SCP was realised
during World War I.
Single-cell protein refers to the crude, or
a refined edible protein, extracted from pure
microbial cultures or from dead or dried cell
biomass.
Microorganisms like algae, fungi, yeast,
and bacteria have very high protein content in
their biomass. These microbes can be grown
using inexpensive substrates like agricultural
waste viz. wood shavings, sawdust, corn cobs,
paraffin, N-alkanes, sugarcane molasses, even
human and animal wastes.

The microorganisms utilize the carbon
and nitrogen present in these materials and
convert them into high-quality proteins that
can be used as a supplement, in both human
and animal feed. Besides proteins, SCP is also
rich in vitamins, vitamin B complex, minerals
and fats. The single-cell proteins can be readily
used as fodder for achieving fattening of calves,
pigs, in breeding fish and even in poultry and
cattle farmimg. The microorganisms used for
the production of SCP are as follows :
Fungi : Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma viride
Yeast : Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida
utilis
Algae : Spirulina spp, Chlorella pyrenoidosa
Bacteria : Methylophilus methylotrophus,
Bacillus megasterium.
Advantages of Single-Cell Protein :
• Microorganisms have a high rate of
multiplication that means a large
quantity of biomass can be produced in a
comparatively short duration.
• The microbes can be easily genetically
modified to vary the amino acid
composition. They have high protein
contents- 43% to 85% (W/W basis).
• A broad variety of raw materials, including
waste materials, can be used as a substrate
for SCP. This also helps in decreasing the
number of pollutants.
• SCP serves as a good source of vitamins,
amino acids, minerals, crude fibres, etc.
11.5 Biofortification
It is a method in which crops are breed
(produced) for having higher levels of vitamins,
minerals and fats (i.e. better nutritive value).
Due to this, problem of malnutrition can be
overcome. Following objectives were considered
for the breeding program :

252

•
•
•
•

Protein content and quality
Oil content and quality
Vitamin content
Micronutrient content and quality

Biofortification can be achieved through
conventional selective- breeding practices and
also through r-DNA technology. It focusses on
making plant food more nutritive as plants grow
or develop.
Some examples of biofortification :
• Fortified Maize having twice the amount
of amino acids- lysine and tryptophan.
• Wheat -Atlas 66 has a high protein content
and Iron-fortified rice has 5 times more
iron, are developed.
• Vegetable crops like carrot and spinach
have more vitamin A and minerals.
• Vitamin C enriched bitter gourd, tomato
have been developed by IARI.
11.6 Animal husbandry :
Animal husbandry is an agricultural
practice of breeding and raising livestock. It is
not only a skill of farmers but also is as much
a science, as it is an art.
Animal husbandry deals with care and
breeding of livestock like buffaloes, cows,
pigs, horses, cattles, sheeps, camels, goats, etc.
which are useful to humans. It also includes
poultry farming, fish farming, bee keeping,
sericulture, lac culture, etc. Animals like honey
bees, silk worms, prawns, crabs, birds, fishes,
pigs, cattles, sheeps and camels have been used
by humans for the products like milk, eggs,
meat, wool, honey, silk, etc.
During the conventional practices of
animal breeding, just taking care is not enough
to give maximum yield. Although India and
china have 70% of world livestock population,
surprisingly the productivity serves only 25%
of the world farm produce.
So professional approach is needed to
boost the production. It requires management
procedures, new technologies to be employed
in various farm system to achieve improvement
in quality and productivity. Industrial principles
of production, processing and marketing are to
be employed.

Management of farms and farm animals :
Farm management starts from selection of
high yielding breeds, their food requirements,
supply of adequate nutritional sources,
cleanliness of the environment and maintenance
of health. Management of farm animals includes
veterinary supervision, vaccination, high
yielding cross breed development, production
and preservation of products, distribution and
marketing.
A. Animal breeding :
Breeding of animals is an important aspect
of animal husbandry. Animal breeding aims at
increasing the yield of animals and improving
the desirable qualities of the products.
Breed:
A group of animals related by descent
and similar in most characters like general
appearance, features, size, configuration, etc.,
are said to belong to a breed.
Animal breeding is done for getting
improved breeds with desirable qualities of
product and to increase yield of animals,
Desirable characters such as increased
production of milk, quality of product, quality
of meat or maximum yield of eggs per year
etc., are necessarily achieved through animal
breeding.
Can you tell?
Find out the name of common breeds
of cattle and poultry in the farms, found in
your area.
Breeding can be of two main types inbreeding and outbreeding :
a. Inbreeding : It involves breeding of closely
related individuals for 4 to 6 generations.
Inbreeding increases homozygosity. By
inbreeding, pure lines of animals can
be obtained. Inbreeding is helpful in the
elimination of harmful recessive genes and for
the accumulation of superior genes. Inbreeding
has the demerit that it usually reduces the
fertility and productivity.

253

b. Outbreeding: It involves breeding of
unrelated animals. The animals may be of the
same breed but having no common ancestors
for 4 to 6 generations.
Outcrossing involves breeding between the
animals of different species. It is also known as
interspecific hybridization. Outcrossing helps
to remove the inbreeding depression.
Crossbreeding involves the breeding
of superior male of one breed with superior
female of another breed. By cross-breeding,
new animal breeds of desirable characters are
developed. e.g. Hisardale is a new breed of
sheep developed from crossing of Bikaneri ewe
and Marino rams in Punjab.
Interspecific hybridization involves
breeding of animals of two different but related
species. It result in the formation (production)
of animals with desirable characters from both
the parents. But such breeding is not always
successful e.g. Mule is a breed obtained from
horse and donkey.
Artificial
insemination
technique
involves controlled breeding experiments.
Semen from selected superior males is collected
and preserved in frozen state or injected into
the genital tract immediately. It is useful to
overcome problem of normal mating and
convenience of transportation.
Multiple Ovulation Embryo Transfer
(MOET) involves the technology which
provides the chances of successful production
of hybrids. In this method, cow is administered
with FSH like hormone, to induce follicular
maturation and then the super ovulation is
brought about. In each cycle, 6 to 8 eggs mature
simultaneously. The cow is either mated with
an elite bull or artificially inseminated. The
blastocysts at 8 to 32 cell stage are recovered
non-surgically and transferred to surrogate
mothers. This technology is successfully used
in cattles, sheeps, rabbits, buffaloes, etc.
High milk yielding breeds of female and high

quality meat yielding bulls have been found to
be successful, to increase herd size in a short
period.
B. Dairy farm management :
Dairy industry involves production,
processing and distribution of milk and
milk products. Milk is a valuable food stuff
universally consumed by human beings. Milk
yield mainly depends on the quality of breeds in
the farm. Selection of good breeds having high
yielding potential under the climatic conditions
of inhabiting area, and disease resistance is the
basic requirement. In India, cows and buffaloes
are mainly used for dairy farms. Sahiwal,
Sindhi, Gir are Indian breeds and Jersy, Brown
Swiss, Holstein are exotic breeds, which are
used in dairy farming. Buffaloes are restricted
to some part of Asia only.
In India, six breeds occur viz, Jaffarabadi,
Mehsana, Murrah, Nagpuri, Nili, Surati,
which are all good milk producers. Cattles
have to be well looked after. Quality and
quantity of fodder in proper ratio, should be
given. Silage made from legumes and grasses,
maize and jowar, makes good feed. Silage
is supplemented with oil cakes, minerals,
vitamins and salts. Cleanliness and hygiene of
the cattles and handlers is of more importance
while milking, storage and transport of milk
and milk products. In recent years, much of
these processes are mechanised, which reduce
the chance of direct contact with the product.
The shed must be cleaned daily. It should be
spacious with adequate facilities for feeding,
watering and lighting.
Do you know ?
Regular visit of veterinary doctor to
dairy farm is mandatory, why ?
Milk
processing,
marketing
and
distribution, play an important role in dairy
industry. Variety of milk product like curd,
cream, butter, ghee, condensed milk, khoa,

254

cheese must be prepared from extra milk and on
demand. An additional income can be obtained
in the cattle farms from cow dung, manure, fuel
cakes and gobar gas for cooking and lighting.
C. Poultry farm management :
Poultry includes number of bird species
such as chicken, ducks, turkey, and fowls which
are domesticated for their eggs and meat.
Can you tell?
1. What is layer ?
2. What is broiler ?
Allied professions to poultry include
processing of eggs and meat, marketing
of poultry products, compounding and
sale of poultry feed, poultry equipment,
pharmaceuticals, feed additives, etc.
Selection of proper and disease free breed,
suitable and safe farm condition, proper
feed and water, hygiene and health care,
are important requirements for poultry farm
Management. On the basis of their origin,
different types of poultry breeds are : American
breeds Plymouth Rock, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island Red; Asiatic breeds are Brahma,
Cochin and Langshan; Mediterranean breeds
are Leg horn, Minorca; English breeds include
Australorp; Indian breeds are Chittagong,
Aseel, Brahma, and Kadaknath.
Leghorn is best layer (for eggs) while
Playmouth rock, Rhode Island Red, Aseel,
Brahma and Kadaknath, are preferred as
broilers (for meat).
Management of layers, requires purchase
of high yielding chicken, well ventilated
farms, proper feed, debeaking, lighting,
waterer, sanitation, culling and vaccination.
Management of broilers requires selection
of breed, housing, temperature, ventilation,
lighting, floor space and broiler feed. Different
types of poultry diseases are:

i. Viral diseases like Ranikhet, Bronchitis,
Avian influenza (bird flu), etc. Few years
back, bird flu have seriously influenced poultry
farming and human infection too.
ii. Bacterial diseases mainly includes
Pullorum, Cholera, Typhoid, TB, CRD (chronic
respiratory disease), Enteritis, etc.
iii. Fungal diseases are Aspergillosis, Favus
and Thrush.
iv. Parasitic diseases include lice infection,
round worm, caecal worm infections, etc.
v. Protozoan diseases e.g. Coccidiosis is a
protozoan disease.
D. Apiculture or bee keeping :
Apiculture or bee keeping deals with an
artificial rearing of honey bees to obtain bee
products like honey, wax, pollens, bee venom,
propolis (bee glue) and royal jelly as well as
pollinating agents for crop plants.

Fig. 11.4 : Bee hive
Bee keeping is an ancient cottage industry.
Honey is a food of high nutritive value and
also finds uses in the indigenous system of
medicines.
Can you tell?
Why are honey bees called as best
pollinators?
The four species of honey bees commonly
found in India are Apis dorsata (rock bee or
wild bee), Apis florea (little bee), Apis mellifera
(European bee) and Apis indica (Indian bee).

255

seasons, handling and collection of honey, bee
wax and other products. Periodic inspection for
cleanliness of hive boxes, activity of bees and
queen, condition of brood, provision of water,
is very much necessary.
Many Indian crop fields need the services
of honey bees as the pollinators. Bee keeping in
the crop field of sunflower, mustard, safflower,
chilly, cabbage, cucumber, legumes, fruits like
apple, mango, citrus, etc. help in increasing
the productivity of honey as well as crops
tremendously.

Knowledge enhancer :
For bee keeping, Apis mellifera and Apis
indica are the suitable species, hence they
are known as domesticated species.

Bee keeping is practiced in the areas
where sufficient wild shrubs, fruit orchards
and cultivated crops are present. Bee keeping
requires the equipments like bee hive boxes,
with comb foundation sheets, bee veil, smoker,
bee brush, gloves, gumshoes, uncapping knife,
swarm net, queen excluder, overall hive tool,
etc.

E. Fishery :
Fishery is a branch of applied biology
which deals with the catching, processing, fish
farming and marketing of fish, and other useful
aquatic animals such as, prawns, lobsters,
oysters, mussels and crabs. Three division of
fishery are- inland fishery, marine fishery and
estuarine fishery.
Inland fishery includes culturing and
capturing of fish from fresh water bodies like
ponds, lakes, dams and river. Inland aquatic
area of our country covers about 40 to 50 lakh
acres. The common fresh water fish are Labeo
rohita (rohu), Catla (catla), Cirrhina mrigala
(mrigala) and other carps.

Knowledge enhancer :
Fish farming or culturing of edible and
commercially important fish is only possible
in fresh water bodies.
Marine fishery includes capture of fish
from sea water. Indian coastal line is about
7500 km long. The common marine fish
are Harpadon (Bombay duck), Sardinella
(sardine), Rastrelliger (mackerel) and
Stromateus (pomphret).
Can you tell?

F. Sericulture :
Sericulture is the branch of applied
zoology which deals with rearing of silkworm
and production of silk. Like other farming,
sericulture also involves skill and scientific
knowledge for rearing and development. It
require less investment and can be started in
small space. It is the oldest business and large
number of families are associated with the
production of silk in India. Disabled, older
persons, handicapped people can successfully
do this job.

1. Give the names of estuaries found in
Maharashtra and where these estuaries
are located.
2. Enlist the names of different fish found at
an estuary.

Cocoon

Estuarine fishery includes capture of fish
from estuary. Estuary is a place where river
meets the sea. e.g. Sunderban area in west
bengal.
The common factors for the maintenance
of fish farm, includes selection of suitable
site, excavation of ponds, requirements of
hatchery tank, nursery tank, rearing tank,
stocking tank or ponds, water source, manures,
supplementary feed, etc. The culture fishery
may be monoculture (only one species) or
polyculture (many species) type.
After catching the fishes, fish spoilage is
prevented by different preservation methods
like chilling, freezing, freeze drying, sun
drying, smoke drying, salting and canning. In
addition to the source as nutritious food, fish
yield a number of by-products which are of
commercial value. They are fish oil, fish meal,
fertilizers, fish guano, fish glue and isinglass.
These by-products are widely used in paints,
soaps, oils, and medicine. Prawns and Lobsters
have market value all over the world. Fishery
provides good job opportunities and self
employment to many people.

Internet my friend
Collect information about life cycle of
silk moth.
The best quality silk called mulberry silk,
is produced by silkworm Bombyx mori, while
Tussar silk and Eri silk are of inferior quality.
The quality and quantity of silk depends on the
quality of mulberry leaves on which the larvae
feed.
Rearing, development and looking after
the silkworms, involve skill and labour for
constant watch. A little negligence can spoil
the complete industry. Silkworm larvae may
be infected by protozoans, viruses and fungi.
Besides these, ants, crows, birds, and other
predators are ready to attack these insects,
hence the cages of these larvae must be
managed to prevent predators attack.

Can you tell?
1. What are the different stages found in life
cycle of silkworm?
2. Process of cocoon formation.
3. Which process is involved in silk
production from cocoon ?
G. Lac culture :
Lac is produced by an insect Trachardia
lacca, which is quite small in size and colonial
in habit. Resin like substance is produced by
Dermal glands of female lac insect. Insect feeds
on succulent twigs of certain plants like ber,
peeple, palas, kusum, babool, etc and secretes
pink coloured resin, that hardens on coming in
contact with air forming lac. It is produced on
a large scale all over India.
Lac is a complex substance having large
amount of resin together with sugar, water,
minerals and alkaline substances.
Natural lac is always contaminated.
Shellac is pure form of lac obtained by washing
and filtering. Lac insect is a native of India and
our share is 85 % of total lac produced in the
world. Products of lac play a vital role in the
economy of the farmers. Lac is used in bangles,
toys, woodwork, inks, mirrors, etc. Production

11.7 Microbes in human welfare :
Biotechnology is the applications of
‘Scientific and Engineering principles for the
processing of materials by biological agents
to provide goods and service to humans or for
human welfare’.
There are variety of microorganisms like
algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses, protozoans,
nematodes, etc. and their products that exhibit
benificial activities which are used for welfare
of humans in regard to food, health, industry,
agriculture, medicine, biocontrol, etc. These
organisms are used variously in food and feed
technology, industry, waste utilization, energy,
etc.
Microbes in food preparation :
The development of biotechnology
occurred in two phases viz, traditional (till
1971) and modern (after 1970). Traditional
biotechnology is based on the fermentation
principle by using fermenting bacteria. These
were used in the preparation of variety of
indigenous fermented food products.

258

1. Dosa, Dhokla and Idli:
The dosa, idli and dhokla are fermented
products produced due to activity of bacteria.
They are fermented preparation of rice and
black Gram with air borne Leuconostoc and
Streptococcus species of bacteria. CO2 produced
during fermentation causes puffing up of the
dough.
Can you tell?
Name the microbes used in fermentation
of dhokla.
Find out
Names of some edible mushrooms
and poisonous mushrooms.
2. Microbes as the Source of Food :
Some microbes or their fruiting bodies are
directly used as a source of food, as they are
rich in vitamins and proteins. The term “SCP”
or “single cell protein” denotes, dead and dried
cells of microbes like bacteria, algae, molds
and yeasts.
Some mushrooms and truffles are directly used
as food. They belong to higher fungi. They
produce large, fleshy fruting bodies which are
edible. Fruting bodies are sugar free, fat free
but rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals and
amino acids. The food in the fruting body is
low caloried.
3. Dairy Products:
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) like
Lactobacillus are added to milk. It ferments
lactose sugar of milk into lactic acid. Lactic
acid causes coagulation and partial digestion of
milk protein casein. Milk is changed into curd,
yoghurt and cheese. The starter or inoculum
used in preparation of milk products actually
contains millions of lactic acid bacteria (LAB).
i. Curd:
Indian curd is prepared by inoculating milk
with Lactobacillus acidophilus. It also checks
growth of disease causing microbes.

ii. Yoghurt (= yogurt):
It is produced by curdling milk with
the help of Streptococcus thermophilus and
Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
iii. Butter Milk:
The acidulated liquid left after churning of
butter from curd, is called butter milk.
iv. Cheese:
The milk is coagulated with lactic acid
bacteria and the curd formed is filtered to
separate whey. The solid mass is then ripened
with growth of mould that develops flavour in it.
Different varieties of cheese are known by their
characteristic texture, flavor and taste which
are developed by different specific microbes.
The ‘Roquefort and Camembert cheese’ are
ripened by blue-green molds Penicillium
roquefortii and P. camembertii respectively.
The large holes in Swiss cheese are developed
due to production of a large amount of CO2
by a bacterium known as Propionibacterium
shermanii.
11.8 Role of Microbes in Industrial
Production:
During fermentation, variety of products
like alcoholic beverages, organic acids,
vitamins, growth hormones, enzymes,
antibiotics, etc. are produced.
Do you know ?
These are actually the secondary
metabolites produced during idio phase and
are not required by micro-organisms for their
growth. The type of substrate and the type of
micro-organism result into the production of
particular secondary metabolites.
Production on an industrial scale requires
growing microbes in very large vessels, called
fermenters. The main function of a fermenter is
to provide a controlled environment for growth
of a microorganism, or a defined mixture of
microorganisms, to obtain the desired product.

259

Yeast movement

a. Production of Alcoholic Beverages :
Beverage is a liquid used or prepared for
drinking e.g. tea, coffee, beer, wine, which
acts as stimulant. Alcoholic beverages are
the products of alcoholic fermentation of
specific substrates. Use of microbes in malking
alcoholic beverages, is known since vedic
period- 5000 to 7000Bc.
Microbes
especially
yeast
have
been used from time immemorial for the
production of beverages like wine, beer,
whiskey, brandy or rum. For this purpose,
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae var.
ellipsoidis (commonly called Brewer’s Yeast)
is used for fermenting malted cereals and fruit
juices to produce ethanol. Among the
beverages, Wine and Beer are produced without
distillation whereas whiskey, brandy and
rum are distilled beverages. Tubular tower
fermenter is used for large scale production of
alcohols.
Several traditional drinks and foods are
also made through fermentation by yeast.
Today, a traditional drink of the coastal region,
in South India, is made by fermenting the sugar
sap extracted from palm plants and coconut
palm. The famous wine of Goa, traditionally
known as ‘fenny’ is made by fermenting fleshy
pedicels of cashew fruits.

directly from glucose (e.g. gluconic acid) or
formed as end products from pyruvate or
ethanol.
Organic acid
Microbes used
i. Citric acid
Aspergillus niger
ii. Gluconic acid
Aspergillus niger
iii. Fumaric acid
Rhizopus arrhizus
iv. Acetic acid (vinegar)
Acetobacter aceti
The organic acids are further used variously
e.g. citric acid is used in confectionary, fumaric
acid in resins as wetting agents and gluconic
acid in medicine for solubility of Ca++.
c. Production of vitamins:
Vitamins are some organic nitrogenous
compounds which are capable of performing
many life-sustaining functions inside our body.
These compounds cannot be synthesized by
humans (except vitamin D), and therefore they
have to be supplied in small amounts in the diet.
Microbes are capable of synthesizing the
vitamins and hence they can be successfully used
for the commercial production of many
of the vitamins e.g. thiamine, riboflavin,
pyridoxine, folic acid, pantothenic acid, biotin,
vitamin B12, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene (provitamin A) and ergosterol (provitamin D).
Vitamins are manufactured by fermentation
using different microbial sources as mentioned
below:
Name of the vitamin
Microbial source
i. Vitamin B2

Alcohol

i. Neurospora gossypii
ii. Eremothecium ashbyi

b. Production of organic acids:
Microbes are also used for the commercial
and industrial production of certain organic
acids. These compounds can be produced

d. Production of Antibiotics:
Antibiotics are probably the most important
group of compounds synthesized by industrial

260

microorganisms. Most antibiotics are secondary
metabolites. They have therapeutic importance
and are used in medical treatment. These are
produced in small amounts by certain microbes
(like bacteria, fungi and few algae), which
inhibit growth of other microbial pathogens.
Therefore, they are used in medicine. The
antibiotics are antibacterial, antifungal, etc.
Antibiotics have greatly improved our
capacity to treat deadly diseases such as
plague, whooping cough, diphtheria, leprosy,
etc.

Enzymes are proteins known as biocatalysts. Due to their ability to promote
reactions more quickly at body temperature and
more efficiently. Many microbes synthesize
and excrete large quantities of enzymes
into the surrounding medium. Using this
feature of these tiny organisms, many enzymes
are produced commercially. These enzymes
are Amylase, Cellulase, Protease, Lipase,
Pectinase, Streptokinase and many others.
Several industrial sectors, use enzymes
from microorganisms for specific applications.
In the textile industry, enzymes are able to
improve the quality of the fabrics. In the
pulp and paper industry, they are involved in
biomechanical pulping and bleaching, in the
food industry, they are used in the fermentation
processes for the production of bread and
drinks such as wine and beer, also they
participate in the extraction of substances, such
as carotenoids and olive oil; lipases are used in
detergent industry, because they have superior
cleaning properties, increasing the brightness
and removing of oil stains; they are also used
in cosmetics, animal feed and agricultural
industries, among others. Following are the
few examples of enzymes used in industrial
food processing:

f. Gibberellin production:
Gibberellin is a group of growth hormones
mainly produced by higher plants and fungi
to promote growth by stem elongation. The
first gibberellin was isolated by two Japanese
scientists -Yabuta and Sumiki (1938) from rice
seedlings infected with the fungus Gibberella
fujikouri.

261

Extra information: Streptokinase enzyme
(TPA) is produced by the bacterium
Streptococcus spp. It has fibrinolytic effect.
Hence, it is used as a ‘clot buster’ for clearing
blood clots in the blood vessels of patients,
which may cause heart attack.
Statins produced by the yeast Monascus
purpureus have been produced on commercial
scale. It is a blood-cholesterol lowering agent.
This agent acts as competitive inhibitor
of the enzyme responsible for synthesis of
cholesterol.

Do you know ?
The oil eating bacteria can clean up
crude spills. Collect more information about
these bacteria.

About 15 different types of gibberellins
have been isolated. Gibberellins have many
practical applications. They are used to induce
parthenocarpy in apple, pear, etc. They are
used in breaking the dormancy of seed and
also in inducing flowering in Long Day Plants
(LDP). They are also used to enlarge the size
of grape fruits.

Composition of Sewage:
Sewage consists of approximately 99.5%
to 99.9% water and 0.1 to 0.5% inorganic and
organic matter in suspended and soluble form.
Composition of sewage varies depending upon
the type of waste discharged into water from
different industries. e.g. textile, chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, dairy, canning, brewing,
meat packing, tannery, oil refineries and meat
industries, etc.

11.9 Microbes in Sewage Treatment:
Sewage is a matter carried off in
drainage. It is a municipal waste containing
human excreta, house hold waste, dissolved
organic matter and even pathogenic microbes
(bacteria, viruses, protozoans, nematodes and
microfungi). It also includes discharged water
from hospital waste, slaughter house waste,
animal dung, etc. Discharge from industrial
waste (contains toxic dissolved organic and
inorganic chemicals), tannery, pharmaceutical
waste, etc. also add to sewage.

Microorganisms in Sewage:
Various types of micro-organisms are
also present in sewage. Bacteria, viruses,
fungi, protozoa, nematodes, algae, etc. are
found in sewage. However, their number and
type, fluctuate depending upon the sewage
composition and source of sewage. Raw
sewage may contain millions of bacteria per
ml. These include coliforms, fecal Streptococci,
anaerobic spore forming bacilli and other types
originating in the intestinal tract of humans.
Before waste water is made available for
human use, it has to be treated properly, so as
to remove organic matter, inorganic salts and
pathogens as well. Sewage treatment process
includes four basic steps as follows:

Extra Information : Sewage is also a
potential source of pathogenic bacteria,
viruses and protozoa. The causative agents
of dysentery, cholera, typhoid, polio and
infectious hepatitis may occur in sewage.
The bacteria from the soil are also present
in the sewage. During the course of sewage
decomposition, initially aerobic and
facultative anaerobic organisms predominate
which are then followed by strict anaerobic
especially methogenic bacteria that produce
methane (CH4) and CO2.

1. Preliminary Treatment:
The preliminary treatment includes
Screening and Grit Chamber.
i. Screening : Sewage and waste water
contains plenty of suspended, floating
materials, coarse and solid particles along
with dissolved substances. The suspended
objects are filtered and removed. This is
done in screening chambers. The sewage
is passed through screens or net in the
chambers. Larger suspended or floating
objects are held back in the screening
262

chambers. These have to be removed before
the biological treatment.
ii. Grit Chamber : After screening, the filtered
sewage is then passed into series of grit
chambers. These chambers contain large
stones (pebbles) and brick-ballast. Coarse
particles settle down by gravity. Thus,
passage of filtered sewage removes much of
the coarse particulate matter.

mechanically and air is pumped into it. Aerobic
bacteria grow vigourously and form flocs.
Flocs are the masses of bacteria held together
by slime and fungal hyphae to form mesh like
masses. These aerobic microbes consume the
major part of the organic matter present in
the effluent, as they grow. Due to this BOD
(Biochemical Oxygen Demand) of the effluent
is significantly reduced.

2. Primary treatment (physical treatment):
After the preliminary treatment, the
sewage water is pumped into the primary
sedimentation tank. The sedimentation of
suspended solid or organic matter occurs in
this tank. About 50-70% of the solids settle
down. There is reduction of about 30-40% (in
number) of coliform organisms. The organic
matter which is settled down, is called primary
sludge which is removed by mechanically
operated devices. The supernatant (effluent) in
the primary sedimentation tank still contains
large amount of dissolved organic matter and
micro-organisms which can then be removed
by the secondary treatment.

4. Tertiary treatment:
Once the BOD of waste water is reduced, it
is passed into a settling tank. Here the bacterial
flocs are allowed to sediment. The sediment
is now called activated sludge. Small part of
this is passed back in to aeration tank and the
major part is pumped in to large tanks called
anaerobic sludge digesters. In these tanks,
anaerobic bacteria grow and digest the bacteria
and fungi in the sludge. During this anaerobic
digestion, gases such as methane, hydrogen
sulphide, CO2, etc. are produced. Effluents
from these plants (digester) after chlorination,
are released in natural water bodies like rivers
and streams. Chlorination kills pathogenic
bacteria. Digested Sludge is then disposed.

3. Secondary
treatment
(biological
treatment):
The primary effluent is passed into large
aeration tanks. Here it is constantly agitated

11.10 Microbes in Energy Genration :
Many
developing
countries
are
encouraging for installation of biogas plants
to meet out the requirement of energy. Biogas
is used as a domestic as well as industrial
fuel. It is a non-conventional and renewable
source of energy and is obtained by microbial
fermentation. Biogas is a mixture of methane
CH4 (50-60%), CO2 (30-40%), H2S (0-3%) and
other gases (CO, N2, H2) in traces. Biogas is
highly inflamable and is used as a source of
energy.
Plant wastes, animal wastes, domestic
wastes, agriculture waste, municipal wastes,
forestry wastes, etc. are commonly used
for biogas production. Cattle dung is most
commonly employed substrate for biogas
production. It is a rich source of cellulose from
plants.
Biogas Production:
Most commonly used models of biogas
plants are KVIC and IARI. The digester used
for biogas production is called Biogas Plant. A
typical biogas plant using cattle dung as a raw
material, consists of digester and gas holder.
Digester is made up of concrete bricks and
cement, or steel. There is cylindrical gas holder
or gas tank above it to collect gases. Digester
has a side opening (charge pit) into which raw
material as cow dung is fed. The digester is
partly burried in the soil.
Anaerobic digestion involves in three
processes :
i. Hydrolysis or solublization : In initial
stage raw material (cattle dung) is mixed
with water in equal proportion to make
slurry which is then fed into the digester.
Here anaerobic hydrolytic bacteria (e.g.
Clostridium, Pseudomonas) hydrolyse
carbohydrates into simple sugars, proteins
into amino acids and lipids into fatty acids.

ii. Acidogenesis : In this stage, facultative
anaerobic, acidogenic bacteria and obligate
anaerobic organisms, convert simple
organic material into acids like formic
acid, acetic acid, H2 and CO2.
iii. Methanogenesis :
This is last stage in which anaerobic
Methanogenic bacteria like Methanobacterium,
Methanococcus convert acetate, H2 and CO2
into Methane, CO2 and H2O and other products.

Benefits:
1. It is a cheap, safe and renewable source of
energy. It can be easily generated, stored
and transported.
2. It can be used for domestic lighting,
cooking, street lighting as well as small
scale industries.
3. It burns with blue flame and without smoke.
4. It helps to improve sanitation of the
surrounding.
5. It is eco-friendly and does not cause pollution
and imbalance of the environment. Sludge
which is left over is used as a fertilizer.

11.11 Role of Microbes as Biocontrol Agents:

Table 11.14 : Microbes and their host

The term biocontrol refers to the use of
biological methods to control diseases and
pests. The natural method of eliminating and
controlling insects, pests and other diseasecausing agents, is by using their natural,
biological enemies. This is called biocontrol
or biological control.

Pathogen
Bacteria:
Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt)
B.
papilliae
and
B.lentimorbus
Fungi:
Beavueria bassiana,
Entomophthora.
pallidaroseum, and
Zoopthora radicans
Protozoans:
Nosema lacustae

The agents which are employed for this
are called biocontrol agents. Microbes are one
among them. These microbes include bacteria,
fungi, viruses and protozoans. Microbes as
biocontrol agents act in three ways, either they
cause the disease to the pest or compete or kill
them. Chemicals, insecticides and pesticides
are extremely harmful to human beings and
also pollute our environment. Hence, the use
of biocontrol measures will greatly reduce our
dependence on toxic chemicals and pesticides.

Host
Caterpillars,
cabbage worm,
adult beetle,etc.
Aphid
crocci,
A.
unguiculata,
mealy bugs, mites,
white flies etc

Grasshopper,
caterpillars,
crickets
Viruses:
Caterpillars and
Nucleopolyhedrovirus Gypsy moth, ants,
(NPV) and Granulovirus wasps and beetles.
(GV)

Examples of Microbial bio-control :

Bioherbicides :

i. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is used to get
rid of butterfly, caterpillars where dried
spores of Bacillus thuringiensis are mixed
with water and sprayed onto vulnerable
plants such as Brassicas and fruit trees.
These spores are then eaten by the insect
larvae. In the gut of the larvae, the toxin
(cry protein) is released and the larvae get
killed eventually.

Weeds are the unwanted plants that grow
in agricultural fields, ponds, lakes, etc. Weeds
compete with the main crop in the farm- land for
water, space, minerals, light, air, etc. and also
act as collateral hosts for several pathogens.
Microbes are also used as herbicides. Many
dicot herbs that grow in the field of cereals as
weeds, can be killed by certain microbes. For
examples :

ii. Trichoderma species are free-living fungi
found in the root ecosystem (rhizosphere).
These are effective as biocontrol agents of
several soil borne fungal plant pathogens.
The fungus produces substances like
viridin, gliotoxin, gliovirin, etc. that inhibit
the other soil borne pathogens attacking
root, rhizomes, etc. causing rot disease.

II. Microbial Herbicides and Their Host :

Four groups of biocontrol agents are
known. They are bacteria, fungi, viruses and
protozoans.
I. Microbial Pesticides and their host :
The corelation is depicted as per the
following table :

ii. Xanthomonas spp.- attacks several weeds
iii. Agrobacterium spp.- attacks several
weeds

3. Insects as herbicides :
i. Tyrea moth - controls the weed Senecio
jacobeac
ii. Cactoblastis cactorum - controls cacti
weeds.
11.12 Role of Microbes as Biofertilizers:
Fertilizers are nutrients which are
necessary for the growth of plants and thus
for the productivity of cultivated plants. Use
of fertilizers for increasing productivity is one
of the aspects of green revolution. Fertilizers
are classified as inorganic (chemical) and
organic (biological). Inorganic fertilizers
are synthetic where mineral salts of NPK are
mixed in definite proportion and then dusted
in the field. Non-judicious or excessive use of
such fertilizers lead to pollution of soil, air and
ground water. Soil becomes acidic.

1. N2 fixing Biofertilizers: The nitrogen
fixing microorganisms which convert
atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogenous
compounds like nitrites and nitrates via
ammonia. Nitrogen fixing microorganisms,
also called diazotrophs, are of two types:
iii. Symbiotic N2 fixing microorganisms:
for eg. Rhizobium, Anabaena, Frankia.
These are always associated generally
with underground parts i.e. roots of
higher plants.
iv. Free-living or Non- Symbiotic N2 fixing
microorganisms: e.g. Azotobacter,
Nostoc,
Clostridium,
Beijerinkia,
Klebsiella, etc.

Organic fertilizers are biological in origin
and include Farm Yard Manure (FYM),
compost and green manure. Use of these
fertilizers increases the fertility of soil.
Now a days for better and sustainable
agricultural
production
farmers
use
biofertilizers and practise organic farming.
Biofertilizers are mostly N2 fixing, living
microorganisms which enrich the nutrient
quality of soil. They include bacteria,
cyanobacteria and fungi.
Biofertilizers are commercial preparation
of ready-to-use live bacterial or fungal
formulations. Their application to plant, soil or
composting pits, helps to enrich the soil fertility
due to their biological activity.
Use of Biofertilizers is cost effective
and eco-friendly. They play a vital role in
maintaining a long term soil fertility and
sustainability.
Types of Biofertilizers:
On the basis of nature and function
biofertilizers are divided into following groups266

2.

Phosphate solubilizing biofertilizers:
These are the bacterial species which
solubilize the insoluble inorganic
phosphate compound, such as rock
phosphate. For eg. Pseudomonas striata,
Bacillus
polymyxa,
Agrobacterium,
Microccocus, Aspergillus spp., etc.

3. Compost making biofertilizers:
Composting is a natural process that
turns organic material into a dark rich
substance called as compost or humus.
The composting process is dependent
on microorganisms to break down
organic matter into compost. There are
many types of microorganisms found in
active compost such as bacteria, fungi,
actinobacteria, protozoa and rotifers.
4. Cyanobacteria as biofertilizers :
Many cyanobacteria are aquatic and
terestrial, free-living or symbiotic, aerobic,
photosynthetic, N2 fixing, heterocystous or
non-heterocystous forms. e.g. Anabaena,
Nostoc, Plectonema, Oscillatoria, etc.
Anabaena, Nostoc and Tolypothrix are
associated with lichens while Anabaena
is associated with plants like Azolla and
Cycas.

less irrigated lands. The association of VAM
with crop plants helps in conversion of less
productive field into more productive field.

Classification of Biofertilizers :
On the basis of nature or group of
organisms, biofertilizers are classified as
bacterial fertilizers and fungal fertilizers.
Bacterial fertilizers include eubacteria
and cyanobacteria. On the basis of function,
bacterial fertilizers are further grouped as
nitrogen fixing, phosphate solubalizing and
compost making biofertilizers. Cynobacterial
biofertilizers, on the basis of function, are
nitrogen fixing type.
Fungal
biofertilizers
include
mycorrhizal fungi. On the basis of function,
they are classified as ectomycorrhizae and
endomycorrhizae.

Benefits of Mycorrhiza :
1. Selective absorption of P, Zn, Cu, Ca, N,
Mn, Br and Fe.
2. Enhance water uptake.
3. Induce growth by secreting hormones.
4. Offer protection to host plant from other
microbes, by secreating antibiotics.
Do you know ?

5. Fungal biofertilizers:
Mycorrhiza is a fugus. It forms symbiotic
association with the underground parts like
rhizomes and root of higher plants occuring
in thick humid forests. These are discovered
by Frank (1885). Their are two types viz,
Ectomycorrhizae and Endomycorrhizae.
I. Ectomycorrhizae: They have well
developed mycelium that forms mantle
on the outside of the roots. This increases
absorptive surface area of roots and
accelerates uptake of water and nutrients (N,
P, Ca and K). Due to this the plant vigour,
growth and yield increase. Some hyphae of
mycorrhizal fungus, penetrate into the root
and forms hartig-net in the intercellular
spaces of root cortex.
II. Endomycorrhizae: They grow in between
and within the cortical cells of roots. Fungal
hyphae penetrate the cells and form finely
branched arbuscules intracellularly and
form vesicles mostly in the intercellular
speces of cortical cells. Hence they are called
Vesiculo Arbuscular Mycorrhizae or VAM.
Now a days they are described as AM fungi.
The plants with VAM grow luxuriantly in

Now a days, mycorrhiza are classified
into 8 different types viz, Ectomycorrhizae,
Endomycorrhizae,
Ectendomycorrhizae,
Orchidaceous
mycorrhizae,
Ericoid
mycorrhizae,
Arbutoid
mycorrhizae,
Monotrapoid mycorrhizae and Ophioglossoid
mycorrhizae.

Biofertilizer microorganisms:
1. Rhizobium: Rhizobia are rod shaped,
motile, aerobic, gram negative, non
spore forming, nitrogen-fixing bacteria
containing Nod genes and Nif genes. They
form symbiotic association with roots
of leguminous plants. They bring about
nodule formation on the roots and multiply
inside the nodule. They fix atmospheric
nitrogen into organic forms, which can
be used by plants as nutrients. For eg. R.
leguminosarum is specific to pea. and R.
phaseoli to beans.
2. Azotobacter: It is the important and well
known free living, nitrogen fixing, aerobic,
non-photosynthetic, non-nodule forming,
bacterium, intimately associated with roots
of grasses and certain plants. It is used as a
Bio-fertilizer for all non-leguminous plants
especially rice, cotton, vegetables, etc.

In the dorsal lobe, Anabaena filaments
are present in the aerenchyma, which fixes
nitrogen. Azolla can be used as biofertilizer
in the rice field.

3. Azospirillum: It is free living, aerobic
nitrogen fixing bacterium associated with
roots of corn, wheat and jowar. It fixes the
considerable quantity of nitrogen (20-40kg
N/ha) in non – leguminous plants such as
cereals, millets, cotton, oilseed, etc.

Benefits of Biofertilizers :
1. Low cost and can be used by marginal
farmers.
2. Free from pollution hazards.
3. Increase soil fertility.
4. BGA as biofertilizers secret growth
promoting substances, organic acids,
proteins and vitamins.
5. Azotobacter
supply
nitrogen
and
antibiotics in the soil.
6. Biofertilizers increase physico-chemical
properties of soil- like texture, structure,
pH, water holding capacity of soil by
providing nutrients and organic matter.

4. Anabaena : It is a genus of multicellular,
filamentous cyanobacteria that exits as
plankton. It has ability to fix nitrogen and
also forms symbiotic relationships with
certain plants, such as the coralloid roots of
Cycas and Anthoceros thallus. It has some
specialized and colourless cells, called
Heterocysts which are the sites for nitrogen
fixation.
5. Azolla: Azolla is a free-floating water fern.
Azolla plant consist of a floating rhizome
(stem) with small overlapping bi-lobed
leaves and roots. The leaf shows dorsal and
ventral lobe.

Now in our country many biofertilizers
are available in market to reduce the use of
chemical fertilizers and thus, the pollution.

Biotechnology
Can you recall?

1. What is Biotechnology?
2. How do genetically modified organisms
are produced?
3. Which are the benefits of Biotechnology?
You are already aware of what
biotechnology is. It is the product of interaction
between the biological science and technology.
It is infact, an applied branch of biology. The
term biotechnology was first used by Karl
Ereky in 1919 to describe a process for large
scale production of pigs.
12.1 Biotechnology
It is defined by different organizations in
different ways. It has been brodly defined as
‘the development and utilization of biological
forms, products or processes for obtaining
maximum benifits to man and other forms of
life’. According to OECD (Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development,
1981)- ‘It is the application of scientific and
engineering principles to the processing of
materials by biological agents to provide
goods and service to the human welfare’.
It uses scientific priciples of microbiology,
genetics biochemistry, chemical engineering,
mathematics, statistics, computers, industrial
processes, etc. Biological agent means plants
and animal cells, microorganisms, enzymes or
their products.
History of origin of biotechnology is as
old as human civilization. Development of
biotechnology in terms of its growth, occurred
in two phases viz, Traditional biotechnology
and Modern biotechnology.
Traditional
biotechnology
(old
biotechnology) was primarily based on
fermentation technology using microorganisms
as in the preparation of curd, ghee, soma,

vinegar, yogurt, cheese making, wine making,
etc. It became an art of kitchen in indian
houses. It was more an art than science. Till
that time people did not know as to how exactly
the process occurs and the organisms causing
this process. The contributions made by several
chemists, biochemists and microbiologist,
over the time, could explain the mechanism of
process and also the nature of microorganisms
causing the process.
During 1970 a new technique of
‘recombinant DNA technology was developed
and then established by Stanley Cohen and
Herbert Boyer in 1973. This technique has
changed the overall outlook, then. The technique
permits to change/ modify genetic (heritable)
material for getting new specific products.
The combination of biology and production
technology based on genetic engineering
evolved into modern biotechnology (new
biotechnology).
There are two major features of technology
that differenciate modern biotechnology from
classical or old biotechnology viz,
i. Capablity of science to change the genetic
material for getting new specific products
through rDNA technology, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), microarrays, cell
culture and fusion, and bioprocessing.
ii. Ownership of technology and its sociopolitical impact.
Now
the
conventional
industries,
pharmaceutical industries, agro industries,
food industries, etc. are also focussing attention
to produce biotechnology- based products.
12.2
Principles
and
Processes
of
Biotechnology :
Modern biotechnology is based on two
core techniques viz. genetic engineering and
chemical engineering.

272

Genetic engineering deals with alteration
of genetic material (DNA and RNA) while
chemical engineering deals with maintaining
sterile environment for manufacturing
variety of useful products including vaccines,
antibodies, enzymes, organic acids, vitamins,
therapeutics, etc.
Genetic engineering is defined as the
manupulation of genetic material towards a
desired end and in a directed and predetermined
way, using in vitro process. Manipulation
of genes involve repairing of the defective
genes or replacing of defective genes by
healthy genes or normal genes; artificially
synthesizing of a totally new gene; transfer
of genes into a new location or into a new
organism; introducing an all together new
gene; manipulation of genes for improvement
of living organisms; combining of genes from
two organisms, altering the genotype; gene
cloning etc. Therefore, the genetic engineering
is alternatively called recombinant DNA
technology or gene cloning.
Extra information :
John E. Smith (1996) gave definition of
genetic engineering as ‘the formation of new
combination of heritable material by the
insertion of nucleic acid molecule produced
by whatever means outside the cells, into any
virus, bacterial plasmid or other vector system
so as to allow their incorporation into a host
organism in which they do not occur naturally
but in which they are capable of continued
propagation’.
Technique of gene cloning and rDNA
technology :
In gene cloning, a gene of known function
can be transferred from its normal location
into a cell (that of course does not contain it)
via a suitable vector. The transferred gene is
replicated normally and is handed over to the
next progeny.

A. Tools and techniques for gene cloning/
rDNA technology :
Before we venture into a procedure of
gene cloning, let us know briefly, the basic
requirements for the technique.
I. Different instruments (devices) :
Macromolecule such as DNA, RNA,
proteins, etc. are synthesized in the living
cells which vary in their molecular weight,
solubility, presence of charges, absorbance
of light, etc. Several techniques are used to
isolate and charaterize the macromolecules.
The size of different types of molecules
varies and therefore their molecular
weights also vary. The techniques used
on the basis of molecular weight, are
gel permeation, osmotic pressure, ion
exchange chromatography, spectroscopy,
mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, etc.
Electrophoresis is the separation of charged
molecules, applying an electric field. It
is applied for the separation of DNA,
RNA and proteins. DNA being negatively
charged, migrates to anode. Small
fragments of DNA molecules, move faster
and thus separate faster. Use of Agarose gel
electrophoresis, PAGE, SDA PAGE are the
different methods of electrophoresis.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) :
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is
another device used for gene cloning or gene
multiplication in vitro. It is the amplification of
gene of interest, through PCR.
In 1985, Kary Mullis made an important
discovery (contribution) in the form of
an extremely powerful technique called
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR can
generate a billion copies of the desired segment
of DNA or RNA, with high accuracy and
specificity, in a matter of few hours. The process
of PCR is completely automated and involves
automatic thermal cycles for denaturation
and renaturation of double stranded DNA.

273

The device required for PCR is called thermal
cycler.

1 copy of desired gene

PCR is in vitro amplification of a desired
DNA segment, which requires : DNA containing
the desired segment to be amplified, several
molecules of
four deoxyribonuclueoside
triphosphates (dNTPs), excess of two primer
molecules, heat stable DNA polymerase and
appropriate quantities of Mg++ ions.

thermostable DNA polymerase are mixed
together in ‘eppendorf tube’ and the following
operations are performed sequentially (Figure).
Step i : The reaction mixture is heated to a
temperature (90–98 oC) to separate two strands
of desired DNA. This is called denaturation.
Step ii : The mixture is allowed to cool
(40–60 oC) that permits pairing of the primer
to the complementary sequences in DNA. This
step is called annealing.
Step iii : The temperature (70–75 oC) allows
thermostable Taq DNA polymerase to use
single-stranded DNA as template and adds
nucleotides. This is called primer extension. It
takes arround two minutes duration.

Cycle continous to produce
2n copies of DNA

Fig. 12.1 : DNA replication through
polymerase chain reaction.
One cycle takes arround 3 to 4 minutes.
To begin second cycle, DNA is again heated
to convert double stranded DNA into single
strands.
In an automatic thermal cycler, the above
three steps are automatically repeated 20-30
times. Thus, at the end of ‘n’ cycles 2n copies
of DNA segments, are produed. The machine
performs the entire operations automatically
and precisely.
Once the desired number of cycles is
completed, the amplified DNA segment is
purified by gel electrophoresis. After its
sequencing, the amplified DNA segment can be
inserted into a cloning vector. Desired gene can
also be obtained from gene library.

II. Biological tools :
There are three types of biological tools
used viz, enzymes, cloning vectors (vehicle
DNA) and competent host (cloning organisms)
for transformation with recombinant DNA.
A. Enzymes : Different enzymes include
Lysozymes, Nucleases such as exonucleases
endonucleases, restriction endonucleases,
DNA ligases, DNA polymerases, alkaline
phosphatases, reverse transcriptases, etc.
i. Restriction enzymes :
Enzymes that cut the phosphodiester bands
of polynucleotide chains are called nuclease.
There of two types - exonuclease and
endonuclease. Exonucleases cut nucleotides
from the ends of DNA strands whereas
endonuclease cut DNA from within. During
the 1970s, it was found that bacteria contain
nucleases that would recognize short nucleotide
sequence with duplex DNA and cut.
The phosphodiester back bone at highly
specific sites on both strands of duplex, is
cut by these enzymes, called restriction
endonucleases or simply restriction enzymes.
They were given this name because they
are used by the bacteria to destroy various
viral DNAs that might enter the cell, thereby
restricting the potential growth of the virus.

Thus, restriction enzymes serve as defence
mechanism. The bacteria protect its own DNA
from nucleolytic attack by methylating the bases
at susceptible sites, a chemical modification
that blocks the action of the enzyme.
The restriction enzymes are thus the
molecular scissors that are used to recognize
and cut DNA at specific sequences. The sites
recognized by them, are called recognition
sequences or recognition sites. Different
restriction enzymes found in different organisms
recognize different nucleotide sequences and
therefore cut DNA at different sites. Table
encloses list of some restriction endonucleases
and the site at which they cleave DNA.

Activity :
Find out the biological source of following
restriction enzymes and discuss the their
recognition sequences :
Pst I, Sal I, Taq I, Xer III, Mbo II, Hpa I,
BgII, Kpn I, Not I.
ii. Recognition sequences :
The sequences recognized by restriction
enzymes are 4 to 8 nucleotides long and
characterized by a particular type of internal
symmetry. Consider the particular sequence
recognized by the enzyme EcoRI .

DNA

Do you know ?
There are three types of restriction
enzyme viz,
Type I - Which fuction simultaniously as
endonuclease and methylase e.g. E co K.
Type II - Which have separate activities for
cleaving and methylation; they are more
stable and are used in rDNA technology e.g.
E co RI, BgII; these enzymes cut DNA at
specific sites within the pallindrome.
Type III - Which cut DNA at specific nonpallindromic sequences e.g. HpaI, MboII.
There are thousands of type II R. E. enzymes
are recognized/ discovered.

A sequence with this type of symmetry
is called a palindrome. When the enzyme
EcoRI attacks this palindrome, it breaks each
strand at the same site in the sequence, which
is indicated by the arrow between the A and G
residues.
3’ ---- C T T A A G -------5’
5’ ---- G A A T T C -------3’
Restriction enzymes either cut straight
across the DNA in the region of palindrome to
give blunt ends or cuts producing short, single
stranded projections at each end of DNA to
produce, cohesive or sticky ends or staggered
ends.
B. Cloning vectors (vehicle DNA) - Vectors
are DNA molecules that carry a foreign
DNA segment and replicate inside the

A good vector should have the ability of
independent replication so that as the vector
replicates (through ori gene) and large number
of copies of the DNA insert will be formed.
Moreover vector should be able to easily
introduce into host cells.

276

A vector should have marker genes for
antibiotic resistance; must contain unique
cleavage site in one of the marker genes for
restriction enzyme; it should have at least
suitable control elements like promoter,
operator, ribosomal binding sites, etc. The
plasmids obtained naturally do not posses all
the characteristics. Hence, they are constructed
by inserting gene for antibiotic resistance.
e.g. pBR 322, pBR 320, pACYC 177 are the
constructed plasmids. pBR 322 is mostly used
in rDNA technology in plants.
i.

Plasmid : The plasmids most commonly
used in recombinant DNA technology are
those that replicate in E. coli. Investigators
have engineered these plasmids to optimize
their use as vectors in DNA cloning.

ii. Plasmid vectors for plants : An important
vector for carrying new DNA into many
types of plants is a plasmid that is found in
Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This bacterium
lives in the soil and causes a plant disease
called crown gall, which is characterized
by the presence of over- growths, or tumors,
in the plant. A. tumefaciens contains a
plasmid called Ti (for tumor-inducing). The
Ti plasmid contains a transposon, called T
DNA, which inserts copies of itself into the
chromosomes of infected plant cells. The

transposon, with the new DNA, can still be
inserted into the host cell’s chromosomes.
A plant cell containing this DNA, can then
be grown in culture or induced to form a
new, transgenic plant.
C. Competent host (cloning organism) used
are usually the bacteria like Bacillus
haemophilus, Helicobacter pyroli and E.
coli.
Mostly E. coli is used for the transformation
with recombinant DNA
12.3 Methodology for rDNA technology :
The steps involved in gene cloning are as
follows :
a. Isolation of DNA (gene) from the donor
organism :
i. The desire gene to be cloned has to be
obtained from the source organism (donor).
Initially the cells of the donor organism are
sheared with the blender and treated with
suitable detergent. Genetic material from
the donor is removed isolated and purified
by using several techniques. Isolated DNA
can be spooled on to a glass rod.
ii. Isolated purified DNA is then cleaved
by using restriction enzymes particularly
Restriction Endonucleases (RE). These
enzymes cleave DNA at specific sites,
called restriction sites and break the DNA
into fragments. There are several types of
restriction endonucleases. Cleaved DNA
fragments have cohesive, sticky, staggered
ends or blunt ends.
From cleaved DNA fragments, a fragment
containing desired gene is isolated and selected
for cloning. This is now called foreign DNA
or passanger DNA. A desired gene can also
be obtained directly from genomic library or
cDNA library.

277

Vector
(a plasmid or bacteriophage)

Do you know ?
A

Gene library is a collection of different
DNA sequences from an organism where
each sequence has been cloned into a vector
for ease fo purification, storage and analysis.
There are two types of gene libraries on the
basis of the source of DNA used.
• Genomic library : It is a collection of
clones that represent the complete genome
of an organism. The genomic library of
prokaryotes can be constructed by using
plasmid vector. It is because prokaryotic
genome does not contain repeatitive
DNA.
• cDNA library : It represents the library
of eukaryotic organisms only. DNA is
produced from isolated mRNA by reverse
transcription. The DNA so made is called
complementary DNA (cDNA). The
library is called cDNA library. Eukaryotic
DNA genome contains introns, regulatary
genes and repeatitive DNA. Hence, the
establishment of genomic library in
eukaryotes is not meaningful

Fig. 12.5 : Outline of the process of
recombinant DNA technology

b. Insertion of desired foreign gene into a
cloning vector (vehicle DNA) :
The foreign DNA or passanger DNA is now
inserted into a cloning vector or vehicle DNA.
The most commonly used cloning vectors are
plasmids of bacteria and the bacteriophage
viruses like lamda phage and M13. The most
commonly used plasmid is pBR 322.
Plasmids are isolated from the vector
organims i.e. bacterium. By using same RE
(which is used in the isolation of the desired
gene from the donor), plasmid i.e. vector DNA
is cleaved.
Now by using enzyme DNA ligase, foreign
DNA is inserted/ integrated into the vector
DNA. The combination of vector DNA and
foreign DNA is now called Recombinant
DNA or Chimeric DNA and the technology is
reffered to as rDNA technology.

c. Transfer of rDNA into suitable competent
host or cloning organism :
Finally the recombinant DNA is now
introduced i.e. transferred for expression into
a competent host cell of the suitable cloning
organism which is usually a bacterium.
Host cell takes up naked rDNA by process
of ‘transformation’ and incorporates into
its own chromosomal DNA which finally
expresses the trait controlled by passenger
DNA. The transfer of rDNA into a bacterial
cell is assisted by divalent Ca++. The cloning
organisms used in plant biotechnology are
E.coli and Agrobacterium tumifaciens. The
host/ competent cell which has taken up rDNA
is now called transformed cell.
Foreign DNA can also be transferred
directly into the naked cell or protoplast of the
competent host cell, without using vector. This

278

is done by using techniques like electroporation,
microinjection,
lipofection,
shot
gun,
ultrasonification, biolistic method, etc. But
in plant biotechnology the transformation is
through Ti plasmids of A. tumifaciens.
d. Selection of the transformed host cell :
The transformation process generates a
mixed population of transformed (recombinant)
and non-transformed (non-recombinant) host
cells. For isolation of recombinant cell from
non-recombinant cell, marker gene of plasmid
vector is employed. For example, PBR322
plasmid vector contains different marker gene
(Ampicillin resistant gene and Tetracycline
resistant gene). When pst1 RE is used, it knocks
out Ampicillin resistant gene from the plasmid,
so that the recombinant cell become sensitive
to Ampicillin.
e. Multiplication of transformed host cell:
Once transformed, host cells are separated
by the screening process. In this step the
transformed host cells are introduced into fresh
culture media.
At this stage the host cells divide and
redivide along with the replication of the
recombinant DNA carried by them.

Animal biotechnology
(Tissue culture, generative
meicine, immunotechnology, GM
animals, pharmacogenomics,
gene therapy)

Environmental biotechnology
(Pollution control, biofuels,
bioremediation, biodiversity)

f. Expression of the gene to obtain the desired
product:
The next step involves the production
of desired products like alcohol, enzymes,
antibiotics, etc. Finally the desired product is
separated and purified through downstream
processing using suitable bioreactor.

The genes are inserted by the side of

recombinant plasmids were then separately
transformed into E. coli host. The
host
produced penicillinase + pre-pro insulin.
Insulin is later separated by trypsin treatment.

a. Healthcare Biotechnology :
It refers to a medicinal or diagnostic
product or a vaccine. This technology has
a tremendous impact on meeting the needs
of patients. Biotechnology offers patients
a variety of new solutions such as: unique,
targeted and personalized therapeutic and
diagnostic solutions for organ transplant, stem
cell technology, genetic counselling, forensic
medicine, gene probes, genetic fingerprinting
and karyotyping are outcomes of biotechnology.

Vaccine production:
A vaccine is a biological preparation that
provides active acquired immunity against a
certain disease. Usually a vaccine consists of
a biological agent that represents the diseasecausing microorganism. It is often made from a
weakened or killed form of the microorganism,
its toxins or one of its surface protein antigens.
Biotechnology has offered modern
diagnostic test kits- rickettsial, bacterial and viral
vaccines along with radiolabelled biological
therapeutics for imaging and analysis.
Vaccines have eliminated small pox,
polio and other deadly diseases for the last
several decades. Biotechnology has made
advancements in vaccination by making
recombinant vaccines that have the potential
to eradicate non-communicable diseases like
cancer. Naked DNA vaccines, viral vector
vaccines and plant-derived vaccines are found
to be most effective against a number of
bacterial and viral disorders.

Human insulin :
Insulin is a peptide hormone produced by
β-cells of islets of Langerhans of pancreas. It
was discovered by sir Edward Sharpey Schafer
(1916) while studying Islets of Langerhans.
Insulin is essential for the control of blood
sugar levels. Diabetes mellitus is a disease
in which some people cannot make insulin
themselves. Hakura et al (1977), chemically

Internet my friend
Collect the information pertaining to
recombinant vaccines and their types protein vaccines and DNA vaccines.
Oral vaccines: a novel approach :
The latest hot spot in the field of vaccine
research is the development of vaccine which
can be taken orally. Immunogenic protein of

280

certain pathogens is found to be active when
administered orally. The gene corresponding to
such proteins is isolated and a gene construct is
produced. This is introduced and expressed in
a plant genome, which results in production of
such immunogenic proteins in the parts of the
plant where it is expressed. These when fed into
animals or mainly humans, the person becomes
vaccinated against certain pathogen. Such
vaccines are also known as edible vaccines.
An exciting invention is production of ‘melt
in the mouth’ vaccines that can be administered
by placing them under your tongue that
delivers it into the blood stream. The most
important example is the production of flu
vaccine by Bacillus which melts in the mouth.
The tremendous benefit of such vaccines, is the
comfort of administeration, low cost and ease
of storage.
b. Agriculture :
Application of Biotechnology in Agriculture
involves scientific techniques such as Genetically
Modified Organisms, Bt Cotton, Pest Resistant
Plants. It helps in modifying plants, animals,
and microorganisms and improve their
agricultural productivity.
Tissue Culture is used in Micropropagation
i.e. large-scale propagation of plants in very
short durations. Tissue culture technique is also
the best method for storing germplasm and
maintaining a specific genetic type (Clone).
This technique is used in those plants, which
produce recalcitrant seeds or produce highly
variable seeds.
Recalcitrant means the reduction in
the seed moisture contents below certain
levels and freezing drastically reduces the
servival and thus present difficulty in storage.
Here, subcellular damage of seeds occur
accompanied by consequent loss of viability,
when dried.

c. Gene therapy:
A gene is a stretch of DNA required to
make a functional product such as part or all of
a protein. During gene therapy, DNA that codes
for specific genes is delivered to individual
cells in the body.
Gene therapy is the treatment of disease
by replacing, altering or supplementing a gene
that is absent or abnormal and whose absence
or abnormality is responsible for the disease.
Most, if not all, diseases have a genetic
factor. The genetic factor can be wholly or
partially responsible for the disease. For
example, in disorders such as cystic fibrosis,
haemophilia, and muscular dystrophy, changes
in a gene directly result in the condition.
In other conditions, such as high
cholesterol and high blood pressure, genetic
and environmental factors interact to cause
disease. There are more than 5000 different
human genetic diseases known to be caused
by single gene defects e.g. sickle cell anaemia,
thalassemia, Tay-sach’s disease, cystic
fibrosis, Huntington’s chorea, haemophilia,
alkaptonuria, albinism, etc.
Gene therapy is being used in many ways.
For example, to:
• Replace missing or defective genes;
• Deliver genes that speed the destruction of
cancer cells;
• Supply genes that cause cancer cells to
revert back to normal cells;
• Deliver bacterial or viral genes as a form
of vaccination;
• Deliver DNA to antigen expression and
generation of immune response;
• Supply of gene for impairing viral
replication;
• Provide genes that promote or impede the
growth of new tissue; and
• Deliver genes that stimulate the healing of
damaged tissue.

Do you know ?
Delivery of genes into cells :
Genes can be delivered by three ways :
i. Ex vivo delivery where cells are removed
from the patients and then gene is
introduced using viral or non-viral vectors
e.g. Parkinsons disease, a neurological
disorder.
ii. In vivo delivery where therapeutic genes
are directly delivered in the cells at the
target sites of the diseased tissue in the
patient- like intravenous infusion genes
to treat cancer are injected directly into
tumor.
iii. Use of virosomes (Liposome + inactivated
HIV), bionic chips are the other methods
of gene delivery.
Forms of gene therapy :
a. Germ line gene therapy : In this method
healthy genes can be introduced into germ
cells like sperms, eggs, early embryos. It
allows transmission of the modified genetic
information to the next generation. Though it
is highly effective in counteracting the genetic
disorders, it is not encouraged for application
in human beings due to a variety of technical
and ethical reasons.
b. Somatic cell gene therapy : In this type the
gene is introduced only in somatic cells like
bone marrow cells, hepatic cells, fibroblasts
endothelium and pulmonary epithelial cells,
central nervous system, endocrine cells and
smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls.
Modification of somatic cells only affects
the person being treated and the modified
chromosomes cannot be passed on the future
generations. Somatic cell gene therapy is the
only feasible option and the clinical trials have
already employed for the treatment of acquired
disorders such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis
and blood disorders including SCID, Gaucher’s

d. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs):
These are living organisms whose genetic
material has been artificially manipulated in a
laboratory through genetic engineering. This
creates combinations of plant, animal, bacteria,
and virus genes that do not occur in nature or
through traditional crossbreeding methods.
Most GMOs have been engineered to
withstand the direct application of herbicide
and/or to produce an insecticide. However,
new technologies are now being used to
artificially develop other traits in plants, such
as a resistance to browning in apples, and to
create new organisms using synthetic biology.
Despite biotech industry promises, there is
no evidence that any of the GMOs currently
on the market, offer increased yield, drought
tolerance, enhanced nutrition, or any other
consumer benefit.
I. Transgenic Plants :
The human race is very dependent on
agriculture and as world populations continue to
expand, there must be continuous reassessment
of agricultural practices to optimize their
efficiency. Since early times human beings have
sought to improve the quality and productivity
of agriculturally important plants. This was
done by selection and traditional breeding
procedures that were painstakingly slow and
difficult. Traditional breeding programmes
involve sexual crosses, which resulted in the
high quality of present day food plants such
as wheat, rice, corn, potato, etc. More recently,
biotechnological approaches have been applied
to these plants to create genetic variations that
are beneficial for mankind.
First transgenic plant produced was
tobacco. More then 60 transgenic dicot plants
and several monocot plant like maize, oat,

282

rice, wheat are known. Tomato, soybean,
potato, sugar beet, grapes, brinjal, cotton are
other transgenic plants. Transgenic plants are
being looked up as bioreactors for molecular
farming i.e. for production of novel drugs like
interferons, edible vaccines, antibodies, amino
acids, immunotherapeutic drugs, etc.
Advantages of GM food-plants :
The ways in which one thinks that
genetically modified plants can help, are listed
as follows:
a. Insect pest resistance:
It can help farmers to reduce their use of
chemical pesticides, which in turn can reduce
the cost of producing food. However, an
alternative has been available for more than
30 years which is a biological insecticide from
the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).
However, the use of B. thuringiensis sprays is
limited because of low stability of the protein
in the field.
Bt cotton is one of the best transgenic
plants known for its insect resistance property.
Insect resistant plants contain either a gene
from B. thuringiensis or the cowpea trypsin
inhibitor gene. The gene called cry gene present
in B. thuringiensis produces a protein that forms
crystalline inclusions in bacterial spores. When
ingested by a susceptible insect, a combination
of high pH and the enzyme proteinase of the
insect’s midgut, processes them hydrolytically
to release the core toxic fragments.

The effect of these fragments is seen within
minutes of ingestion, beginning with midgut
paralysis and ending with disruption of midgut
cells of insect. Bt toxin activity has been against
many species of insects within the orders of
Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.
Golden rice - a transgenic food crop used
to reduce vitamin A deficiency disease.
Similarly, the gene of α-amylase inhibitor
(αAl-Pv) has been isolated from adzuki bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris) and transferred to tobacco
and this gene works against pests like Zabrotes
subfasciatus and Callosobruchus chinensis.
b.
Improved
nutritional
qualities
(biofortification):
Transgenic plants have also been produced
to provide functional food and neutraceuticals.
For millions of people in developing countries,
rice is the main item in their diet. Because
rice does not contain many essential nutrients,
malnutrition is very common in these countries.
Especially terrible is the blindness that
results from a lack of vitamin A. This vitamin
is abundant in milk and in vegetables such as
carrots, which most of the poor people of the
world cannot afford. To solve this problem,
Swiss researchers created transgenic rice
(golden rice) and transgenic mustard (golden
mustard) varieties that are high in vitamin A.
The golden colour is due to vitamin A. They
hoped that this rice, if grown and eaten in
developing countries, would reduce the diseases
associated with vitamin A deficiency (VAD).

Improvement in oil content and oil quality of
oil crops like soybean, oil palm, rapeseed and
sunflower, have been achieved by transfer of
‘Arabidopsis genes’.
Iron deficiency is also a serious nutritional
problem, affecting an estimated 30% of the
world population. For production of transgenic
crops that will produce food rich in iron, an iron
storage protein (ferritin) is targeted. Ferrritin is
found in many animals, plants and bacteria.
The genes for ferritin protein isolated from
soybean and Phaseolus have been transferred
to rice.

d. Plants as factories :
To produce novel biochemicals and
vaccines (Biopharmaceuticals), plants are
potential factories or bioreactors for high
value biochemicals like starch, sugar, lipids,
proteins, and products like fine chemicals,
perfumes and adhesive compounds as well as
industrial lubricants, biodegradable plastic and
even ‘renewable’ energy crops to replace fossil
fuels.

Do you know ?
•

Genetically
engineered
herbicide
tolerant plants are developed as in maize,
wheat and many other monocot plants.

•

Genetically engineered disease resistant
plants (against bacterial and viral
pathogenes) are also developed in crop
plants like tomato, potato and tobacco.

•

Plants deficient in amino acids like
methionine, lysine and tryptophan are
genetically engineered by introducing
genes from other sources so as to make
the seeds protein rich. e.g. Leguminous
plants (pulses), maize, etc.

•

Most of these physiological changes are
due to endogenous enzyme activity. Genetic
engineering has made it possible to slow down
these activities. In the tomato the enzyme
polygalacturonase breaks down the cell wall
constituent- pectin, leading to softening of
fruit during ripening. Thus, the fruits are easily
bruised and damaged on shipment. By inhibiting
the polygalacturonase by antisense genes, the
tomato (genetically modified tomatoes are
called Flavr savr tomatoes) can remain on the
vine until mature and be transported in a firm
solid state.

Biopharmaceuticals
are
proteins,
hormones, antibodies, vaccines or enzymes
isolated from transgenic plants. Some of the
proteins that are being produced by transgenic
crop plants:

Similarly, genetically engineered plants
tolerant to abiotic stresses such as high
temperature, water, cold, etc. are also
developed.

c.
Modification
in
Post-harvest
characteristics:
Diseases and pests, bruising on soft fruits
and vegetables, heat and cold storage, overripeness, loss of flavours and odours, etc.
lead to great deal of losses during storage and
transport of crops.

• Human growth hormone with the gene
inserted into the chloroplast DNA of
tobacco plants.
• Humanized antibodies against such
infectious agents as HIV, Respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), Herpes simplex
virus (HSV), the cause of "cold sores"
• Protein antigens to be used in vaccines
for e.g. Patient-specific antilymphoma (a
cancer) vaccines. B-cell lymphomas are
clones of malignant B cells expressing on
their surface a unique antibody molecule.
Currently many novel products have been
commercially exploited for their products such
as:

284

a. A ‘superglue’ produced by tobacco plants
with genes encoding for powerful adhesive
proteins, enables marine mussels to stick
to rocks. It will be especially valuable
as a biochemical glue for body repairs
during surgery.
b. Transgenic plants, containing oilencoding gene from marine algae,
produce oil that has nutritional value
similar to cod- liver oil.
c. Plant that will produce the antimalarial
drug, Artemisinin.
d. Genetically engineered opium poppy to
produce more powerful painkillers.
e. Transgenic plants producing edible
vaccines:
Genetically altered plants can provide
protection to infectious diseases. Plant products
acting as vaccines would be inexpensive to
produce and thus, can easily be made available
in developing countries. Potatoes, tomatoes,
bananas, soybeans, alfalfa and cereals are
the most common foods proposed for edible
vaccine delivery.
II. Transgenic animals:
Many transgenic animals such as mice, rats,
rabits, pig, sheep, cows, fowls, fish have been
produced through rDNA technology. The term
transgenic animal refers to an animal in which

there has been a deliberate modification of the
genome - the material responsible for inherited
characteristics - in contrast to spontaneous
mutation. Foreign DNA is introduced into the
animal, using recombinant DNA technology,
and then must be transmitted through the germ
line so that every cell, including germ cells, of
the animal contain the same modified genetic
material.
A representative, but non-inclusive, list
of purposes for which transgenic animals
have been used, indicates the wide-ranging
application of this biotechnology:
• in medical research, transgenic animals
are used to identify the functions of specific
factors in complex homeostatic systems
through over- or under-expression of a
modified gene (the inserted transgene);
• in toxicology: as responsive test animals
(detection of toxicants);
• in mammalian developmental genetics;
• in molecular biology, the analysis of the
regulation of gene expression makes use
of the evaluation of a specific genetic
change at the level of the whole animal;
• in the pharmaceutical industry, targeted
production of pharmaceutical proteins,
drug production and product efficacy
testing;

• in biotechnology: as producers of specific
proteins;
• genetically engineered hormones to
increase milk yield, meat production;
genetic engineering of livestock and
in aquaculture affecting modification
of animal physiology and/or anatomy;
cloning procedures to reproduce specific
blood lines; and
• developing animals specially created for
use in xenografting.

The main objectives for improved animal
breeding programmes coupled with this new
technology of gene transfer are given below.
• Efficiency of meat production
• Improved quality of meat
• Milk quality and quantity
• Egg production
• Wool quality and quantity
• Disease resistance in animals
• Production of low-cost pharmaceuticals
and biologicals

a. Transgenic mice and cancer research :
Through laboratory investigations with
transgenic mice that have been modified using
a particular oncogene (cancer causing gene)
and thus developed a certain type of cancer,
questions concerning the relationship between
oncogenes and cancer development could be
answered. Theoretically, such animals can also
be used for research into cancer treatment and
prevention of malignancy.
In the laboratory of Philip Leder in
Harvard (USA) the transgenic mouse model
for the investigation of the breast cancer was
developed. The oncogenes myc and ras were
analysed to find out if they lead to breast cancer
in mice transformed with these genes.

c. Transgenic cattle for food production :
Of the few research reports describing the
use of transgenic technologies in cattle only
one is directed towards a food production
application. Researchers introduced additional
copies of bovine beta or kappa casein into
dairy cattle and evaluated the effect on milk
production and composition. Transgenic
offspring had an 8 to 20% increase in beta
casein and a two-fold increase in kappa casein.

b. Transgenic farm animals :
With the advent of technology, the intention
of researchers is diverted to produce transgenic
farm animals from which the mankind can
derive greater benefits. Many of the farm
animals are improved for their meat production
ability while some of them are improved for
milk yields and quality, and disease-free status.
At the beginning of the century, a dairy cow
provided 2,000 to 3,000 liters of milk a year.

d. Transgenic cattle for human therapeutic
production :
A second application for genetically
modified cattle is the production of human
therapeutic proteins. Human proteins that
have been expressed in milk include human
lactoferrin, human alpha lactalbumin, human
serum albumin and human bile salt stimulated
lipase. The mammary gland in dairy cows is
an excellent protein production factory. On the
other hand, one transgenic cow would be more
than sufficient for production of annual world
supply of factor IX (plasma thromboplastin
component) that is used in the treatment of
haemophilia.
In 1990 Tracy, the transgenic cow was
born in Scotland, and could produce a human
protein in her milk for human therapeutics.

Today, Holstein cow provides 6,000 liters
on average and up to 8,000 – 10,000 for the
best ones. A century ago, a hen laid about 70
Antibodies are currently used for many
eggs a year whereas today the best races lay
different human clinical applications; including
up to 250 eggs per year. This could be possible
treatment of infectious disease, cancer,
because of the advent of biotechnology.
286

transplanted organ rejection, autoimmune
diseases and for use as antitoxins. To make
a human antibody product, the genetically
modified cows are immunized with a vaccine
containing the disease agent.
e. Transgenic Sheep :
Gene transfer technology is applied to
sheep to produce transgenic sheep which
are able to achieve better growth and meat
production as well as to serve as bioreactors.
Human growth hormone gene is introduced
in sheep for promoting the growth and meat
production.
Bacterial genes, cys E and cys M, are
concerned with biosynthesis of cysteine amino
acids involved in formation of keratin protein
found in wool. Both these genes are identified,
cloned and introduced in sheep to increase wool
production and to improve the quality of wool.
f. Transgenic pigs :
The objective of gene transfer in pigs is to
increase growth and meat production and to act
as bioreactors.
Pigs are regarded as the most suitable
animals to be bred for heart transplant because
a pig’s heart is about the same size as a human
heart, and pig heart valves have been used in
human heart surgery for over a decade. The pig
clone is the first step towards providing animal
organs and tissues for human transplants
(xenotransplantation).
g. Transgenic fish :
The commercially important fish like
Atlantic salmon, catfish, goldfish, Tilapia,
zebra-fish, common carp, rainbow trout, etc.
are transfected with growth hormone, chicken
crystalline protein and E.coli hygromycin
resistance gene. Transgenic fish showed
increased cold tolerance and improved growth
and it is the quantity and quality of fish proteins
as well as its preservation, are the factors
affecting the economic value of fish.

h. Transgenic chicken :
Also carry and express foreign genes. They
could be used to improve the genetic make-up
of existing strains with respect to built-in (in
vivo) resistance to viral and coccidial diseases,
better feed efficiency, lower fat and cholesterol
levels and high protein containing eggs, and
better meat quality.
12.5 Bioethics, bio-piracy and bio-patent :
Bioethics:
Ethics usually deals with the matters
related to socially acceptable moral duty,
conduct and judgement. In otherwords, it helps
to regulate the behaviour of cummunity by
some set of standards. However the concepts
differ according to culture and traditions.
Moreover concepts change with the time due
to shifting of perception of values which are
affected by progress in science and technology.
Bioethics helps to study moral vision, decision
and policies of human behaviour in relation to
biological phenomena or events. Ethics deals
with ‘Life’ e.g. in vitro fertilization, sperm bank,
gene theropy, cloning, gene manipulations,
euthanasia, death, maintaining those who are
in comatose state, prenatal genetic selection,
etc.
The era of biotechnology has brought wide
spectrum on new topics like cloning, transgenic,
gene therapy, eugenics, rDNA technology, etc.
The use of all these has drawn a wide range
of reactions in the society. The reactions are
based on individual’s own perception and
moral. Ethical aspects pertaining to the use of
biotechnology seems to be more controversial
and frightening. These concerns are broadly
summarized below :
Use of animals causes great sufferings to
them; voilation of integration of species caused
due to transgenosis; transfer of human genes
into animals and vice versa; indiscriminate use
of biotechnology pose risk to the environment,
health and biodiversity.

287

The introduction of Genetically Modified
Organisms (GMOs) has led to a wider debate
on bioethical concerns affecting social,
economic and environmental spheres. These
include the effects on non-target organisms,
insect resistance crops, gene flow and the loss
of diversity as well as the issue on interfering
with nature in which the modification process
itself is disrupting the natural process of
biological entities. Ethics in biotechnology also
includes the general subject of what should and
should not be done in using recombinant DNA
techniques
12.6 Effects of Biotechnology on the
Environment :
a. Herbicide Use and Resistance :
Effects on the environment are a particular
concern with regard to GMO crops and food
production. One area of development involves
adding the ability to produce pesticides and
resistance to specific herbicides. These traits
are helpful in food production, allowing
farmers to use fewer chemicals, and to grow
crops in less than ideal conditions. However,
herbicide use could be increased, which will
have a larger negative effect on the surrounding
environment. Also unintended hybrid strains of
weeds and other plants can develop resistance
to these herbicides through cross-pollination,
thus negating the potential benefit of the
herbicide. One such herbicide that has already
been added is RoundUp. Crops of RoundUpready soybeans have already been implemented
into agricultural practices, possibly conferring
RoundUp resistance to neighboring plants.
b. Effects on Untargeted Species :
Bt corn, which produces its own pesticide,
is also in use today. It has adverse effects on
Monarch butterfly populations, which are not
the original target of the pesticide. It can also
have unintentional effects on neutral or even
beneficial species.

12.7 Effects of Biotechnology on Human
Health :
a. Allergies :
GMO crops could potentially have negative
effects on human health as well. Consumers
have developed unexpected allergic reactions.
e.g. Researchers used a gene from the Brazil
nut to increase the production of Methionine
in soya beans. The insertion of this gene
inadvertently caused allergic reactions to the
soya bean in those with known nut allergies
(“Biotech Soybeans”).
b. Long-Term Effects :
Because GMO technology has been
available for such a short amount of time, there
is relatively little research which has been
conducted on the long-term effects on health
which we cannot anticipate at this point.
c. New Proteins :
Proteins that have never been ingested
before by humans are now part of the foods
that people consume every day. Their potential
effects on the human body are as of yet
unknown.
d. Food Additives :
GMOs also present us with possibilities
of introducing additional nutrients into foods,
as well as antibiotics and vaccines. This
availability of technology can provide nutrition
and disease resistance to those countries
that don’t have the means to provide these,
otherwise.
However, there is possibility of the creation
of antibiotic and vaccine-resistant strains of
diseases.
This shows that the vast advances in life
sciences and our multicultural and pluralistic
modern societies create numerous bioethical
problems requiring some stringent regulation.
In terms of GMOs, the Indian Government
has set up the Genetic Engineering Approval
Committee (GEAC). This organization makes
decisions regarding the validity of research
involving GMOs and addresses the safety of
GMOs introduced for public use.

288

12.8 Biopatent and Biopiracy :
a. Biopatent :
Patent is a special right granted to the
inventor by the goverment. Patent is a personal
property of inventor. It can be sold like any
other property. A patent consists of three
parts - grant (aggrement with the inventor),
specification (subject matter of invention) and
claims (scope of invention to be protected).
Biopatent is a biological patent. Biopatents
are awarded for strains of microorganisms,
cell lines, genetically modified strains, DNA
sequences, biotechnological processes, product
processes, product and product applications.
Biopatents are awarded to recognize real
innovative contributions made by the inventor
to the cause of human welfare. The awards
are given to inculcate encouragement and
values in developing scientific culture and in
emphasizing the role of biology in shaping
human society.
Indian patent allows ‘process patent’ and
not the ‘product patent’. Biopatent allows the
patent holder to exclude others from making,
using, selling or importing protected invention
for a limited period of time. Duration of
biopatents is five years from the date of the
grant or seven years from the date of filing the
patent application, which ever is less.
First biopatent was patented pertaining
to
genetically
engineered
bacterium
‘Pseudomonas’ used for clearing oils spills.
Patent under the title ‘control of plant gene
expression’ was issued jointly to Delta and
Pineland company and U. S. department of
agriculture. Patent is based on a gene that
produces a protein toxic to plant thus, do not
allow seeds to germinate. However, this patent
was not granted by Indian goverment. Such
a patent is considered morally unacceptable
and fundametally unequitable. This is because
financially powerful corporations would aquire
monopoly over biotechnological process. This
in turn would pose a threat to global food
security.

b. Biopiracy :
Pirates in general terms are those who
steal and kill others to enrich themselves.
Biopirates are those who do not kill but steal
the patent (misuse the patent). Biopiracy is
defined as ‘theft of various natural products
and then selling them by getting patent without
giving any benefits or compensation back to
the host country’. In short, it is unauthorized
misappropriation of any biological resource
and indigenous knowledge.
Most developed, industrialized and
financially rich nations are poor in biodiversity
or traditional knowledge whereas developing
and underdeveloped nations have ample of
biodiversity and they traditionally better know
the use of their bio-resources. Traditional
Knowledge naturally includes a deep
understanding of ecological processes and the
ability to sustainably extract useful products
from the local habitat. Most Traditional
Knowledge is handed down through
generations. This helps them to develop modern,
commercial applications that save the makers
time, money and effort.
Components of Traditional Knowledge that
are especially relevant to our global survival
include knowledge of:
• Food, crop varieties and agricultural/
farming practice
• Sustainable management of natural
resources and conservation of biological
diversity
• Biologically important medicines
The conservation of species, habitat, and
biodiversity are essential to the continued
survival of indigenous and rural people.
By conserving the customs and habitat of
indigenous persons, we concurrently reduce
emissions from deforestation and ecosystem
degradation. Furthermore, the opportunity for
cultural survival is a basic human right. The
traditional knowledge is facing a problem of
bio-piracy.

289

The act of Piracy is unauthorized
publication or reproduction of another person’s
work or material. When someone indulges in
piracy, the accused is using someone’s work
illegally or without taking any permission.
The innovations and discovery of the
pharmaceutical and agricultural researches
are not new as to qualify as invention as they
are based on centuries of knowledge of the
traditional societies.
Examples of Biopiracy :
• Patenting of Neem (Azadirachta indica) :
The people of India in a variety of ways
have used neem, since time immemorial.
Indians have shared the knowledge of the
properties of the neem with the entire world.
Pirating this knowledge, the USDA and an
American MNC W.R. Grace in the early 90s
sought a patent from the European Patent Office
(EPO) on the “method for controlling on plants
by the aid of hydrophobic extracted neem oil.”
The patenting of the fungicidal properties of
Neem, was an example of biopiracy.
• Patenting of Basmati :
Basmati is a long-grained, aromatic variety
of rice indigenous to the Indian subcontinent.
In 1997 the US Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO) granted a patent to a Texas
based American company Rice Tec Inc for
“Basmati rice line and grains” having trade

name Texmati. The patent application was
based on 20 very broad claims on having
“invented” the said rice. Due to peoples
movement against Rice Tec in March 2001, the
UPSTO has rejected all the claims.
• Haldi (Turmeric) Biopiracy :
Two American researchers of Indian
origin of the University of Mississippi Medical
Center, put a claim to the US Patent and
Trademark Office, maintaining that they
had discovered haldi's healing properties.
Surprisingly, they were granted a patent in
March 1995 for something you had known for
years and our ayurvedas for centuries.
It meant they had exclusive rights over any
such haldi drug and were in a position to make
millions of dollars. The Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research (CSIR) applied to
the US Patent Office for a reexamination and
they realized the mistake and cancelled the
patent. This was after Indian scientists shouted
from rooftops about how we are losing our
traditional knowledge to marauding foreign
companies who have started poaching on our
ancient healing techniques.
It is the need of hour to launch genetic
literacy movement in Indian school and colleges
for better understanding of opportunities
and risks related to biotechnology and also
to promote the safe and meaningful use of
technologies of modern life sciences.

Can you recall?
1. What is an ecosystem?
2. What are the abiotic and
components of an ecosystem?

biotic

Natural world around us shows amazing
diversity of forms and complexity of relations.
To understand these, we have to study
levels of organization in the living world
viz. macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs,
individual organism, population, communities,
ecosystems and biomes.
You have already studied in school, that
ecology is a study of the interactions among
organisms and between the organisms and their
physical (abiotic) environment. Term ecology
was first used by Reiter but E. Haeckel gave
substance to the term (introduced) ecology.
Ecological grouping of organisms is
nothing but ecological hierarchy. There are four
sequential levels with increasing complexity
of ecological (biological) organizations viz,
Organism, Populations, Communities and
Biomes. Individual organism is the basic
unit of ecological hierarchy. Organisms of
same kind inhabiting a geographical area
constitute population. Several populations of
different species in a particular area constitute
community that interact with one another
in several ways. Biome constitutes a large
regional terrestrial unit delimited by a specific
climatic zone having major vegetation zone
(plant communities) and the associated fauna.
There are six major groups of terrestrial biomes.
We shall explore first two levels viz, organism
and populations.
13.1 Organisms and the environment
around:
Ecology at the level of organism is basically
the study of animal or plant physiology which
helps us to understand how the organisms

with respect to annual temperature and

You have studied in earlier classes about
the rotation of earth around the Sun and the tilt
of its axis, cause seasons. These seasons with
annual variation in precipitation in the form of
rain and snow, gives rise to formation of major
biomes of the earth like desert, rain forest,
grassland, tundra, etc.
Regional and local variations within each
biome lead to the formation of a variety of
habitats. Major biomes of earth are shown
in Fig. 13.1. On the Earth, life exists even in
extreme and harsh habitats like scorching
deserts of Rajasthan, perpetually rain-soaked
forests of North Eastern states and high
mountain tops of Himalayas.
Find out
What are the key differences that
make such a great variation in the physical
and chemical conditions of different habitats?
Here, we must remember that it is not only
the physico-chemical (abiotic) components
that make up the habitat of an organism, but
the habitat also includes biotic components like

Table 13.2 : The differences between
Habitat and Niche can be summarized as :

plants, pathogens, parasites, and predators of
the organism. We assume that over a period
of time, the organism had through natural
selection, evolved adaptations to optimize its
survival and reproduction in its habitat.
Do you know ?
Ethology - The term was coined by Hilaire
(1854) but was popularised by W. M. Wheeler
(1902). The term denotes (speaks for) the
study of behaviour of animals in relation to
their environment.

Environmental biology (modern ecology)
- The term was introduced in 20th century
(G. L. Clarke 1964, Odum 1969) giving
emphasis on the functional or physiological
interrelationships between the organism and
their surroundings.
Biosphere - All the ecosystems on earth
constitute biosphere.
Habitat and Niche :
Habitat is a place or the set of environmental
conditions around the organism to which it must
adapt to survive and prosper. The term Niche is
used to denote the functional role played by an
organism in its environment (J. Grinnell 1917).
Niche includes various aspects of the life of an
organism like diet, shelter, etc.
A habitat defines the physical space of
an organism with the other living or nonliving factors, while niche describes how
that organism is linked with its physical and
biological environment. In colloquial language
habitat is a postal address while niche is the
profession of organism.

species

Definition of Habitat :
Place or area where a particular species
lives, is its habitat. Factors like the sunlight,
average rainfall, annual temperatures, type
of soil present and other abiotic (topographic)
factors, affect the presence of organisms. These
factors help in determining the presence of the
particular type of species in the environment.
Pond, river, ocean, etc. are the examples
of habitat as many organisms are found in
the same place or habitat. These habitats can
be arboreal, terrestrial, aerial, aquatic, etc.
The immediate surrounding of an organism,
sometimes also referred to as microhabitat,
is an important concept to remember when
working with sedentary or weakly motile
organisms.
Definition of Niche :
The term niche was first time used by ‘J.
Grinnell’. The term ecological niche is still
not well understood and is sometimes even
misused.

294

Niche is described as a position of a species
in the environment like, what they do for their
survival? how they fulfill their needs of shelter,
food? etc. Niche deals with the flow of energy
from one organism to another and hence, it is
important to understand, what an organism
eats, how it interacts with other organisms,
etc. As soon as the niche is left vacant, other
organisms fill that position. The niche is
specific to each species, which means no two
species can share the same niche.
If the species creates its own unique
niche in an ecosystem, it would be helpful in
reducing competition for resources among
species. By taking an example of a bird, it
can be understood that how these birds differ
in their eating habits, where some birds eat
only insects, some only fruits and some can eat
both and anything they come across. So here
we can conclude that these birds living in the
same habitat differ in their niches because of
different eating habits.
Three types of niches are found:
a. Spatial or habitat niche : It deals with the
physical space occupied by the organisms.
b. Trophic niche : It is on the basis of trophic
level of an organism in a food chain.
c. Multidimensional or hypervolume niche:
It considers number of environmental factors
(both biotic and abiotic), the resulting space
will be a hypervolume; not something that can
be perceived by the human mind. This space is
called the hypervolume niche. Alternatively,
it is the position of an organism in the
environmental gradient.
For every species, there is a fundamental
niche and a realized niche. Fundamental niche
is the niche in the absence of all competitors,
this is highly improbable in nature. Hence,
realized niche is more realistic approach, in
the presence of competition for the resources
available in the habitat.

We have seen earlier in the chapter that
each habitat type is regulated by a number of
abiotic or physico- chemical factors.
Key abiotic factors that influence any
habitat are ambient temperature, availability
of water, light and type of soil.
13.2 Major Abiotic Factors :
Temperature:
It is the most ecologically relevant
environmental factor. Average temperature
on land varies from subzero levels in polar
areas and high altitudes, upwards upto 50oC in
tropical deserts in summer. Temperature also
varies seasonally. It decreases progressively
from the equator towards the poles and from
plains to the mountain tops. There are some
unique habitats such as hot springs (80 to
1000C) and deep-sea hydrothermal vents where
average temperatures usually 400o C. Ambient
temperature affects the enzyme kinetics of the
cell and thus, the entire metabolism, activity
and other physiology of the organism.
Only few organisms can tolerate and thrive
in a wide range of temperatures (eurythermal),
but, a vast majority of them are restricted to a
narrow range of temperatures (stenothermal).
Find out
1. Give names of eurythermal and
stenothermal animals and plants?
2. What will be the effect of increasing
global temperatures on the different
habitats and the organisms found in those
habitats?
Water: Availability of water is an important
factor affecting the organisms. As we know,
life on earth originated in water, its availability
is so limited in deserts that only special
adaptations are required to survive there. The
productivity and distribution of plants are also
heavily dependent on water.

295

Organisms living in water bodies such as
oceans, lakes and rivers, have their own waterrelated problems. For aquatic organisms the
chemical composition and pH of water are
important.
The dissolved salt concentration (measured
as salinity in parts per thousand), is less than
5ppt in fresh waters of streams , lakes and
rivers, and 30-35ppt in the seas and oceans.
It may go up to 100ppt in some hypersaline
lagoons.
Some organisms are tolerant for a wide
range of salinities (euryhaline) but others are
restricted to a narrow range (stenohaline).
Many fresh water animals cannot live for long
in sea water and vice versa because of the
osmotic problems, they would face.
Find out
Give examples of an animal and plant
that can survive in fresh water as well as sea
water?
Light: Plants use light for photosynthesis,
which is only source of energy for the entire
ecosystem. Photosynthesis can occur only in
presence of sunlight. Many species of small
plants (herbs and shrubs) growing on forest
floor are adapted to perform photosynthesis
optimally under very low light conditions
because they are constantly overshadowed by
tall trees.
For animals too, diurnal and seasonal
variations in light intensity and duration
(photoperiod) are clues for timing their foraging,
reproductive and migratory activities. The
availability of light on land is closely linked
with that of temperature, since the sun is the
source for both.
Find out
What is the source of energy for the
life in deep ocean trenches where sunlight
does not reach?

Soil: The nature and properties of soil are
dependent on the climate, the weathering
process.
Various characteristics of the soil such
as soil composition, grain size, determine
the percolation and water holding capacity
of the soil. These characteristics along with
pH, mineral composition and topography,
determine the vegetation of an area. Vegetation
in turn dictates the type of animals.
The abiotic factors that determine the type
of habitat, also show considerable diurnal and
seasonal variations. The plants and animals
must adapt to these changes in order to survive
and flourish in the habitat. During the course
of their evolution, many species have evolved
a relatively constant ‘internal’ environment
that permits all biochemical reactions and
physiological functions to proceed with
optimum rate, and allow the species to flourish.
The organisms try to maintain the constancy of
its internal environment (homeostasis) despite
variations in the external environmental
conditions. To survive and flourish in any
environment, organisms must adapt to the
changes in the environment for which there are
following possibilities :
i. Regulate: Some organisms are able to
maintain homeostasis by physiological
and behavioural changes which ensure
constant body temperature, constant
osmotic concentration, etc. All birds and
mammals are capable of such regulation
(thermoregulation and osmoregulation).
ii. Conform: Most of animals and plants
cannot maintain a constant internal
environment. Their body temperature
changes with the ambient temperature. In
aquatic animals, the osmotic concentration
of the body fluids changes with that of the
ambient water osmotic concentration. These
animals and plants are simply conformers.

296

Some species have evolved the ability
to regulate, within a limited range of
environmental conditions, beyond which
they simply conform. If the stressful
environment is localized or only for a short
period of time, the organism may migrate
or suspend its activities.
iii. Migrate: The organism can move away
temporarily from the stressful habitat to
a more hospitable area and return when
stressful period is over. Many animals,
particularly birds, during winter undertake
long-distance migrations to more hospitable
areas.
iv. Suspend: In plants, seeds serve as means to
tide over periods of stress; they germinate to
form new plants under favourable moisture
and temperature conditions. They do so by
reducing their metabolic activity and going
into a state of ‘dormancy’. In animals, the
organism, if unable to migrate may go into
hibernation during winter e.g. polar bear.
Some snails and fish go into aestivation to
avoid summer heat.

organism (morphological, physiological, and
behavioural) that enables the organism to
survive and reproduce in its habitat.
Many desert plants have a thick cuticle
on their leaf surfaces and have their stomata
in deep pits to minimize loss of water through
transpiration. They also have a special
photosynthetic pathway (CAM - Crassulacean
acid metabolism) that enables their stomata
to remain closed during daytime. Some desert
plants like Opuntia, have their leaves reduced
(modified) to spines and the photosynthetic
function is taken over by the flattened stems.
Mammals from colder climates generally
have shorter snout, ears, tail and limbs to
minimize the loss of body heat (Allen’s Rule.)
In the polar seas, aquatic mammals like seals
have a thick layer of fat (blubber) below their
skin acting as an insulator to reduce loss of
body heat.

1. What is homeostasis?
2. Why do animals need to maintain
homeostasis?

living under crushing pressure at great
depths of ocean?

1. Adaptation of plants for aquatic and
desert habitats.
2. Adaptations of animals for aquatic and
desert habitats.
13.3 Adaptation :
To cope up with extreme variations in
their environment, some organisms respond
through physiological adjustments, while
others do so behaviourally (like migration).
These are their adaptations. Therefore, we
can say that adaptation is an attribute of the

Some organisms show behavioural
responses to cope with variations in their
environment. Desert lizards manage to keep
their body temperature fairly constant by
behavioural adaptations. They bask in the sun
and absorb heat, when their body temperature
drops below the comfort zone, but move into
shade, when the ambient temperature starts
increasing. Some species burrow into the sand
to hide and escape from the heat.
13.4 Population :
In nature, we rarely find isolated, single
individuals. They live in groups in a welldefined geographical area, share or compete

297

for similar resources, potentially interbreed
and thus form a population.
Although, it is an individual organism that
has to cope with changes in the environment, it
is at the population level that natural selection
operates to evolve the desired traits. Population
ecology is, therefore, an important area of
ecology because it links ecology to population
dynamics, genetics and evolution.
A population has certain attributes of
its own, which are different from those of an
individual. Basic physical characteristics
of population are - its size and density. Size
speaks for the number of individuals in a
population while density tells us number of
individuals present per unit space, in a given
time. Besides size and density, the other
characteristics include natality, mortality,
immigration, emigration, age pyramids,
expanding population, population growth
forms and biotic potential. An individual has
birth and death, but a population has birth rate
and death rate.
Natality is the birth rate of a population.
It has the greatest influence on a population’s
growth. Natality is a crude birth rate or specific
birth rate. Crude birth rate is used when
calculating population size (number of births
per 1000 population/year), whereas specific
birth rate is used relative to a specific criterion
such as age. E.g. If in a pond, there were 200
carp fish last year and through reproduction
800 new fish are added, taking the current
population to 1000, we calculate the birth rate
as 800/200 = 4 offspring per carp per year.
•

•

It must be remembered, that absolute
natality will be always more than realized
natality.
Mortality is the death rate of a population.
Mortality rate or death rate, is a measure of
the number of deaths (in general, or due to
a specific cause) in a particular population,
in proportion to the size of that population,
per unit of time. Mortality rate is typically
expressed in deaths per 1,000 individuals per
year. Thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1,000)
in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths
per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out
of the total.
Absolute Mortality : the number of deaths
under ideal conditions (with no competition,
abundance of resources such as food and
water, etc.).
• Realized Mortality : the number of deaths
when environmental pressures come into
play.
It must be remembered that absolute
mortality will be always less than realized
mortality.
•

Sex ratio: The sex ratio of the population
affects and is reciprocally affected by birth,
death, immigration, and emigration rates.
It is measured as the ratio of the number
of individuals of one sex to that of the other
sex. The males and females in a ratio of 1:1
is generally the most common evolutionary
stable strategy (ESS).

Absolute Natality : the number of births
under ideal conditions (with no competition,
abundance of resources such as food and
water, etc.).
Realized Natality : the number of births
when environmental pressures come into
play.

from 1: 1 sex ratio in natural habitat?

Age distribution and Age pyramid:
A population is composed of individuals
of different ages. If the age distribution (per
cent individuals of a given age or age group) is
plotted for the population, the resulting structure
is called an age pyramid. For the purpose of
simplicity, the entire population is divided into
three age groups as Pre-Reproductive (age
0-14 years), Reproductive (age 15-44 years)
and Post- reproductive (45-85+ years).
Use your brain power
From the age pyramids given below
(Fig.13.3)- what will be your forecast for
15 years from now for the populations of 1.
Kenya, 2. Australia, 3. Italy and 4. Hungary.
The size of the population it can support
tells us a lot about its status in the habitat. The
population size, in natural habitat, could be
as low as less than 10 (Siberian cranes in bird
sanctuary) or go into millions (Chlamydomonas
in a pond).
Population size, more technically called
population density (designated as N), need
not necessarily be measured in numbers only.
Although total number is generally the most
appropriate measure of population density, it is
in some cases either meaningless or difficult to
determine.

Rapid Growth
e.g. Kenya, Nigeria
Ages 0 -14 years

In an area, if there are millions of termites
/ ants but only a few animals which feed on
them, stating that the population density of
these predators is low, will be misleading.
In such cases, the biomass is a more
meaningful measure of the population
size. Total number is again not an easily
adoptable measure, if the population is huge
and counting is impossible or very timeconsuming. Sometimes, for certain ecological
investigations, there is no need to know the
absolute population densities; relative densities
serve the purpose equally well. For instance,
the number of birds / insects caught per trap is
good enough measure of their total population
density. We are mostly obliged to estimate
population sizes indirectly, without actually
counting them or seeing them. The tiger census
in our national parks and tiger reserves is often
based on pug marks and fecal pellets.
Population Growth :
The size of a population for any species is
a dynamic parameter. It keeps changing with
time, depending on various factors including
food, predation pressure and adverse weather.
In fact, these changes in population density
that give us some idea whether it is flourishing
or declining.

Growth Models: Does the growth of a
population with time show any specific and
predictable pattern? We have been concerned
about unbridled human population growth and
problems created by it in our country and it is
therefore natural for us to be curious if other
animal populations in nature behave the same
way or show some restraint on growth.

Every species is capable of growing
exponentially under unlimited resource
conditions, and reach enormous population
densities in a short time. Darwin showed how
even a slow growing animal like elephant
could reach enormous numbers. (provided food
and space remain unlimited).
But resources like food and space are not
always unlimited. They may be in the beginning;
but as the population density increases, so does
the competition for those resources, resulting
in slowdown in the rate at which the original
population was growing. This results in logistic
or sigmoid growth curve.
ii. Logistic growth: competition between
individuals for limited resources will weed out
the ‘weaker’ ones. Only the ‘fittest’ individuals
will survive and reproduce. In nature, a given
habitat has enough resources to support a
maximum possible number, beyond which
no further growth is possible. Let us call this
limit as nature’s carrying capacity (K) for that
species in that habitat.
Growth (size or weight of the organism)

Density of population in a habitat during a
given period, fluctuates due to changes in four
basic processes. New births (B) and Immigration
contribute to an increase in population density.
Deaths (D) and Emigration lead to decrease
in population density. Immigration (I) is the
number of individuals of the same species that
have come into the habitat from elsewhere
during the time period under consideration.
Emigration (E) is the number of individuals of
the population who left the habitat during the
time period.
So, if N is the population density at time ‘t’,
then its density at time ‘t +1’ can be calculated
as,
Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) – (D + E)]

i. Exponential growth:
Resources like food, space are essential
for any growth of a population. Ideally,
when resources in the habitat are unlimited,
each species has the ability to fully realize
its innate potential to grow in numbers. Then
the population grows in an exponential or
geometric proportion.

A population growing in a habitat with
limited resources show initially a lag phase,
followed by phases of acceleration and
deceleration and finally an asymptote, when
the population density reaches the carrying
capacity. A plot of population density (N) in
300

relation to time (t) results in a sigmoid curve.
This type of population growth is called
Verhulst-Pearl Logistic Growth.
Since resources for growth for most animal
populations, are finite and become limiting
sooner or later, the logistic growth model is
considered a more realistic one.

figures for India for the last 100 years, plot
them and check which growth pattern is

1. What will happen when carrying capacity
of any habitat is exceeded?
2. What could be the reasons behind
enormous increase in human population?

It is obvious that in nature, animals,
plants and microbes do not and cannot live in
isolation but interact in myriad ways to form
a biological community. Interactions may be
intraspecific i.e. existing between organisms
of same population, and interspecific -between
members of different species. The interspecific
interactions occur between minimum two
organisms- plants/ animals/ plant and animal.
Such interaction may be classified as four types
viz, neutralism, negative (harmful), positive
(benificial), and both positive and negative
interactions. Even in simplest communities,
many interactions exist, not all may be easily
seen. Interspecific interactions arise from the
interaction of populations of two different
species. These interactions could be beneficial,
detrimental or neutral (neither harm nor benefit)
to one of the species or both.
Table 13.6 : Interspecific Interactions

Under a particular set of selection
pressures, organisms evolve towards the most
efficient reproductive strategy. Some produce
a large number of small-sized offspring
(Oysters, pelagic fishes) while others produce
a small number of large-sized offspring (birds,
mammals).
Think about it
What can be the reason behind the
different reproductive strategies adopted by
monocot plants like cereals/ pulses and dicot
plants like mango?
13.5 Population Interactions :
There is no natural habitat, which has
only one species or animals or plants. For any
species, the minimal requirement is another
species as food. Even a plant species, which
has photosynthetic abilities, cannot survive
alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the
organic matter in soil and release the inorganic
nutrients.

The various types of interactions are
classified as per the nature of these interactions
to one or both the species. Both the species are
benefited in mutualism and both are harmed in
competition.
In parasitism and predation only one
species benefits (parasite and predator,
respectively) and the interaction is detrimental
to the other species (host and prey, respectively).
The interaction where one species is benefitted
and the other is neither benefitted nor harmed is
called commensalism. In amensalism, on the
other hand one species is harmed whereas the
other is unaffected.
Mutualism:
This interaction is obligatory and
interdependent. It benefits both the
species. Lichens represent an intimate,
mutualistic relationship between a fungus
and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria.
The most spectacular and evolutionarily
fascinating examples of mutualism are found
in plant-animal relationships. Plants need the
help of animals for pollinating their flowers
and dispersing their seeds. Animals obviously
have to be rewarded in the form of pollen and
nectar for pollinators and juicy and nutritious
fruits for seed dispersers.

But the mutually beneficial system should
also be safeguarded against ‘cheaters’, for
example, animals that try to steal nectar
without aiding in pollination. Plant-animal
interactions often involve co-evolution of the
mutualists, that is, the evolutions of the flower
and its pollinator species are tightly linked with
one another.
Competition:
Competition is the type of interaction
where both the species are at a loss. Totally
unrelated species may compete for the same
resource e.g. in shallow creeks on the west
coast of Mumbai, visiting flamingos and
resident fish compete for their common food,
the zooplankton. Secondly, resources need not
always be limiting for competition to occur.
In competition, the feeding efficiency of one
species is reduced due to the interference or
inhibitory presence of the other species, even if
resources (food and space) are abundant, e.g.
Leopards do not hunt in close proximity of lion
pride. Therefore, competition is best defined as
a process in which the fitness of one species is
significantly lower in the presence of another
species.

Gause’s ‘Competitive Exclusion Principle’
states that two closely related species
competing for the same resources cannot coexist indefinitely and the competitively inferior
one will be eliminated eventually. This may be

302

true if resources are limiting, but not otherwise.
In interspecific competition with sufficient
resources, species facing competition will
evolve mechanisms that promote co-existence
rather than exclusion. One such mechanism is
‘resource partitioning’. If two species compete
for the same resource, they could avoid
competition by choosing different times for
feeding.

Fig. 13.9 : Lion standing over dead
leopard- removing competition
A species whose distribution is restricted
to a small geographical area because of the
presence of a competitively superior species, is
found to expand its range when the competing
species is removed.
Parasitism:
Parasitism has evolved in so many
taxonomic groups from plants to higher
vertebrates. Many parasites have evolved to
be host-specific (they can parasitize only a
single species of host) in such a way that both
host and the parasite tend to co-evolve, against
each other. In accordance with their life styles,
endoparasites evolved special adaptations
such as the loss of unnecessary sense organs,
presence of adhesive organs or suckers to cling
on to the host, loss of digestive system and high
reproductive capacity.
The life cycles of parasites are often
complex, involving intermediate hosts or
vectors to facilitate transfer to the host. The
malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax needs
a vector (mosquito) to spread to other hosts.

Majority of the parasites harm the host.
They may reduce the survival, growth and
reproduction of the host and may lead to death
of the host, thus reducing its population density.
They might render the host more vulnerable to
predation by making it physically weak.
Use your brain power
1. Should an ideal parasite be able to thrive
within the host without harming it?
2. Why didn’t natural selection lead to
the evolution of such totally harmless
parasites?
Parasites that feed on the external surface
of the host organism are called ectoparasites.
The most familiar examples of this group are
the lice on humans and ticks on dogs. Many
marine fish are infested with ectoparasitic
copepods. Cuscuta, a parasitic plant that is
commonly found growing on hedge plants, has
lost its chlorophyll and leaves in the course of
evolution. It derives its nutrition from the host
plant which it parasitizes.
Brood parasitism in birds is a fascinating
example, in which the parasitic bird lays its
eggs in the nest of its host bird and lets the
host bird incubate them. During the course of
evolution, the eggs of the parasitic bird have
evolved to resemble the host’s egg in size and
colour to reduce the chances of the host bird
detecting the foreign eggs and ejecting them
from the nest. Eggs of the parasitic bird (Asian
koel) hatch before that of its host (Common
Indian crow).

303

Fig. 13.10 : Crow feeding Asian Koel
hatching in its own nest.

Predation:
When we think of predator and prey, most
probably it is the tiger and the deer that readily
come to our mind, but a sparrow eating any
seed is no less a predator.
Although grazers are animals eating plants,
classified as herbivores, they are, not very
different from predators. Predators play many
important roles. They keep prey populations
under control. Without them, prey species
would reach very high population densities and
cause ecosystem instability e.g. in absence of
frogs, locusts increase in density and destroy
large tracts of agricultural lands. Biological
control, methods adopted in agricultural pest
control are based on the ability of the predator to
regulate prey population. Predators also help in
maintaining species diversity in a community,
by reducing the intensity of competition among
competing prey species.
When certain exotic species are introduced
accidentally or intentionally into a new
geographical area, they become invasive
and start spreading rapidly due to absence
of natural predator, e. g. zebra mussels in the
intertidal zone of North America.
Internet my friend
Name the invasive species of plants and
animals in India.
If a predator over exploits its prey, then the
prey might become extinct and following it, the
predator will also become extinct for lack of
food. This is the reason why predators in nature
are ‘prudent’.
Prey species have evolved various defenses
to reduce the impact of predation. It is a kind
of ‘evolutionary arms race’. Better camouflage
for concealment, faster speed for escape are for
the prey and the predator has to counter these,
by its own means. Some species of insects and
frogs are cryptically coloured (camouflaged)
to avoid being detected easily. The Monarch

butterfly is highly distasteful to its predator
(bird) because of a special chemical present
in its body. Interestingly, the butterfly acquires
this chemical during its caterpillar stage by
feeding on a poisonous weed.

Fig. 13.11 : Adult Monarch butterfly
displaying warning colour pattern
For plants, herbivores are the predators.
Plants therefore have evolved variety of
morphological and chemical defenses against
herbivores. Thorns (Acacia, Cactus) are
the most common morphological means
of defense. Many plants produce and store
chemicals that make the herbivore sick. When
chemicals/ produce are eaten, they inhibit
feeding or digestion of predator and disrupt
reproduction or even kill it. Calotropis growing
in abandoned fields, produces highly poisonous
cardiac glycosides and that is why you never
see any cattle or goats browsing on this plant.
A wide variety of chemical substances that
we extract from plants on a commercial scale,
(nicotine, caffeine, quinine, strychnine, opium,
etc.,) are secondary metabolites produced by
them actually as defences against grazers and
browsers.
Commensalism:
This is the interaction in which one species
benefits and the other is neither harmed nor
benefited. An orchid growing as an epiphyte on

304

a branch of mango tree, will get benefit while
the mango tree derives no benefit. The cattle
egret and grazing cattle in close association,
is a classic example of commensalism. Cattle
egrets always forage close to cattle, as cattle
move they flush out insects that might be
difficult for the egrets to find and catch.
Another example of commensalism is
the interaction between sea anemone that has
stinging tentacles and the clown fish that lives
among them.
The fish gets protection from predators
which stay away from the stinging tentacles.
The anemone does not appear to derive any
benefit by hosting the clown fish.

2. Meaning of the term habitat.
3. Importance of ecology for humans.
An ecosystem is a self regulatory and
self sustaining structural and functional unit of
nature (biosphere). It contains both biotic and
abiotic components. Biotic components interact
with each other and also with the surrounding
environment. Tansley (1935) coined the
term ecosystem. Ecosystems vary greatly
in size from a small pond to large oceans or
small farmland to village. Entire biosphere
can be considered as one global ecosystem,
made up of many local ecosystems. Since the
earth ecosystem is too big and too complex
to be studied, it is divided into two basic
categories, viz. terrestrial and aquatic. Forest,
grassland and desert are the types of terrestrial
ecosystems while lakes, wetlands, rivers and
estuaries are the types of aquatic ecosystems.
The ecosystems can also be classified as
Natural ecosystems and Artificial ecosystems.
Natural ecosystems do not require any human
inputs, in other words they are self-sustainable.
Artificial ecosystems e.g. a farm land, a fish
tank or even a large pond used for rearing fish,
require constant input in terms of energy or
materials.
In this chapter, we will study and
analyse the structure of the ecosystem, in order
to appreciate the input (productivity), transfer
of energy (food chain/web, nutrient cycling)
and the output (degradation and energy loss).
We will also look at the relationships, chains
and webs that are created because of the energy
flows within the system.

14.1 Ecosystem :
Structure and Function :
We have already studied the various
biotic and abiotic components of the
environment. We know that all these biotic
and abiotic components influence each other.
Let us now look at these components with an
integrated approach and see how the flow of
energy takes place in ecosystem. Interaction
of biotic and abiotic components, results in
a physical structure that is characteristic for
each type of ecosystem. Identification and
enumeration of plant and animal species of an
ecosystem gives its species composition.

Fig. 14.1 : Stratification of plants in forest
Biotic and abiotic components differ as the
locations vary in space and time. The variation
due to space results in spatial pattern. There are
two types of spatial patterns. viz. Stratification
and Zonation.
Vertical distribution of different species of
plants and animals occupying different levels,
is known as stratification. For example, trees
occupy top vertical strata or layer of a forest,
shrubs the second and herbs and grasses occupy
the bottom layer. Similar stratification is also
observed in the open seas as epipelagic, mesopelagic, bathy-pelagic and benthic zones.

Horizontal distribution of plants and
animals on land or in water, is called zonation.
Zonation is observed in aquatic (wetlands) as
well as terrestrial ecosystems, but it is easily
seen at the junction of the two. Edges of a large
lake or beach show pronounced zonation in the
form of Inter-tidal, Littoral, Sub-littoral zones.

Think about it

Why is zonation more pronounced at
the edges of habitat?
The biotic and abiotic components of an
ecosystem are all linked together to function as
an ‘ecosystem unit’ through various processes
like, Productivity, Decomposition, Nutrient
cycling and Energy flow. In fact, these are
functional aspects of ecosystem.
Any ecosystem must perform these
four processes for its sustainance (to be self–
sustaining). The ecosystem understudy may
be as small as a pond or entire biosphere as
a whole. The process of productivity involves
conversion of inorganic chemicals into organic
material with the help of the radiant energy
of the sun by the autotrophs and consumption
of the autotrophs by heterotrophs. The
Decomposition is the break down of dead
organic material and mineralization of the
dead matter. The nutrient cycling is the storage

and transport of nutrients. (minerals released
in decomposition process are used again by
autotrophs). The energy flow is unidirectional
flow of energy from producers to consumers
and finally dissipation and loss as heat.
Example- Think of a small pond ecosystem.
It is fairly a self-sustainable unit that explains
the complex interactions which exist in any
aquatic ecosystem. A pond is a shallow water
body in which all the above four aforesaid
basic processes of an ecosystem are observed.
The abiotic component is water with all the
dissolved inorganic and organic substances and
also the rich soil deposit at the bottom of the
pond. The solar input, the cycle of temperature,
day-length and other climatic conditions
regulate the rate of function of the entire pond.
The producers include the phytoplankton,
algae and other aquatic plants. The consumers
are represented by the zooplankton, aquatic
insects and fish. The decomposers are the fungi,
bacteria located at the bottom of the pond.
a. Productivity :
A constant input of solar energy is the basic
requirement for any ecosystem to function
and sustain. Productivity refers to the rate of
generation of biomass in an ecosystem. It is
expressed in units of mass per unit surface (or
volume) per unit time, for instance grams per
square metre per day (g/ m2/ day). The mass
unit may relate to dry matter or to the mass
of carbon generated.
It can be divided into gross primary
productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity
(NPP). Gross primary productivity of
an ecosystem is the rate of production of
organic matter during photosynthesis. Plants
themselves use a considerable proportion of
this GPP for their respiration. Hence, gross
primary productivity minus respiratory losses
(R) constitute the net primary productivity
(NPP).

309

GPP – R = NPP

Net primary productivity is the
available biomass for the consumption, to
heterotrophs (herbivores, carnivores and
decomposers). The annual net primary
productivity of the whole biosphere is
approximately 170 billion tons (dry weight) of
organic matter. Of this, the productivity of the
oceans is only 55 billion tons. Rest of course, is
from land based ecosystems.

By the process of leaching, water soluble
inorganic nutrients go down (percolate) into the
soil horizon and get precipitated as unavailable
salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade
detritus into simpler inorganic substances. This
process is called as catabolism. It is important
to note that all the above steps in decomposition
operate simultaneously on the detritus.
A tree grows in the soil.

Some are eaten by
herbivors. Nutrients and
energy enter food web.

Use your brain power
What could be the reason for the low
productivity of ocean?
Primary productivity (GPP) depends on the
plant species inhabiting a particular area. It also
depends on a variety of environmental factors,
availability of nutrients and photosynthetic
capacity of plants. Therefore, it varies in
different types of ecosystems. Secondary
productivity is defined as the rate of
formation of new organic matter by consumers.
Alternatively, it is the rate of assimilation of
food energy at the level of consumers. It is the
amount of energy available to consumer for
transfer to the next trophic level.
b. Decomposition :
Decomposers break down complex organic
matter into inorganic substances like carbon
dioxide, water and nutrients, and the process
is called decomposition. Dead remains of
plants and animals, including fecal matter,
constitute detritus, which is the raw material
for decomposition. The important steps in the
process of decomposition are fragmentation,
leaching, catabolism, humification and
mineralization.
Detritivores (e.g. earthworm) break down
detritus into smaller fragments or particles.
This process is called fragmentation.

Fig. 14.3 : Decomposition cycle
Humification and mineralization occur
during decomposition in the soil. Humification
leads to accumulation of partially decomposed,
a dark coloured, amorphous, colloidal organic
substance called humus that is resistant to
microbial action and undergoes decomposition
at an extremely slow rate. Humus formation
changes soil texture and increases water
holding capacity of soil.
Being colloidal in nature humus serves as
a reservoir of nutrients. The humus is further
degraded by some microbes and release of
inorganic nutrients occurs by the process
known as mineralisation.
Decomposition as a process requires
oxygen. Temperature and soil moisture are
the most important factors that regulate
decomposition indirectly to help soil microbes.
Warm and moist environment favours
decomposition whereas low temperature and
anaerobic conditions inhibit decomposition.

14.2 Energy Flow :
Sun is the only source of energy for all
ecosystems on the earth except for the deep-sea
ecosystems. Of the total incident solar radiation,
less than 50 % of it is photosynthetically active
radiation (PAR). Plants and photosynthetic
bacteria (autotrophs) fix energy to prepare food
from simple inorganic materials. Plants capture
only 2-10 % of the PAR and this small amount
of energy sustains the entire living world.
Therefore, it is very important to know
how the solar energy captured by plants flows
through different organisms of an ecosystem.
Directly or indirectly, all organisms are
dependent for their food on producers. Hence
there is unidirectional flow of energy from
sun to producers and then to consumers. The
direction can not be reversed. Energy can be
used only once in the ecosystem.
The autotrophs need a constant supply
of energy to synthesize the molecules they
require. The autotrophs are called producers.
In a terrestrial ecosystem, major producers
are herbaceous and woody plants. Likewise,
producers in an aquatic ecosystem are
phytoplankton and algae.
Find out
1. Is there any presence of living organisms
in the perpetual darkness of deep oceanic
trenches?
2. In absence of solar radiation, what is their
source of energy?
3. Which organisms do serve as producers in
the food chains of deep oceans?
All animals directly or indirectly
depend on plants for their food. They are hence

called consumers (heterotrophs). If they feed
directly on the plants, they are called primary
consumers, and if the animals eat other animals
which eat plants, they are called secondary
consumers. Likewise, you could have tertiary
consumers too.
The primary consumers are also known
as herbivores. Some common herbivores are
insects (grasshopper, aphids), birds (parrot)
and some mammals (sheep, cattles, goat,
donkey) in terrestrial ecosystem and molluscs
in aquatic ecosystem. The consumers that feed
on these herbivores are carnivores, (secondary
consumers). Those animals that depend on
the primary carnivores for food are called
secondary carnivores.

Chart 14.4 : Trophic levels
You have studied several food chains
and food webs that exist in nature. Food chains
are always straight and usually have four or
five trophic levels. There are three types of food
chains viz. grazing, detritus and parasitic.
Starting from the plants (or producers) food
chains and food webs are formed such that an
animal feeds on a plant or on another animal
and in turn is food for another. The energy
trapped by the producer, is either passed on to
a consumer or remains trapped till the producer
organism dies. Death of organism is the
beginning of the detritus food chain/web.

The detritus food chain (DFC) begins
with dead organic matter. It is composed
of decomposers which are heterotrophic
organisms, mainly fungi and bacteria. They
meet their energy and nutrient requirements
by degrading the detritus. These are known as
saprotrophs. Decomposers secrete enzymes
that breakdown dead organic materials
into simple, inorganic materials, which are
absorbed by them. Detritus food chain may be
connected with the grazing food chain at some
levels. In a natural ecosystem, some animals
like cockroaches, crows, bears, man, etc. are
omnivores. Omnivores eat producers as well
as consumers. These natural interconnection of
food chains make it a food web.

Every organism occupies a place in
ecological community according to the source
and method of obtaining its food. Organisms
occupy a specific place in the food chain that is
their trophic level. Producers belong to the first
trophic level, herbivores (primary consumer)
to the second and carnivores (secondary
consumer) to the third trophic level.

The amount of energy available
decreases at each successive trophic level.
The number of trophic levels in any food
chain is restricted as the transfer of energy
follows ‘10% Law’ (R. Lindermann, 1942).
The law states that ‘only 10 % of the energy
is transferred to each trophic level as net
energy, from the previous trophic level’. In
nature, it is possible to have different trophic
levels - producer, herbivore, primary carnivore,
secondary carnivore, tertiary carnivore and
ultimate carnivore.

From the given food web diagram, give
the trophic levels where the eagle is present.

What is the maximum number of
trophic levels in a food chain?
312

Beyond secondary carnivores, however
the amount of energy available is too less,
hence, there is no tertiary carnivore that feeds
exclusively on secondary carnivore, even
though the secondary carnivore many times will
feed on herbivores directly. This is the reason
why food chains do not exist in isolation, but
are always interconnected to form food web
that maintains the stability of an ecosystem.

The three ecological pyramids which are
usually studied are : Pyramid of biomass,
Pyramid of numbers and Pyramid of energy.

In most well balanced ecosystems, all the
pyramids, of number, energy and biomass are
upright, i.e. producers are more in number and
biomass than the herbivores, and herbivores
are more in number and biomass than the
carnivores. There are exceptions to this, e.g.
oceanic ecosystem show inverted biomass
pyramid.

Fig. 14.7 : Pyramid of Biomass

Pyramid is a structure which has broader
base that gradually narrows upwards forming
an inverted cone like structure. This concept
was developed by C. Elton in 1927.

The relative number of individuals per
unit area at different trophic levels, constitutes
the number pyramid; of biomass/ unit
area, is biomass pyramid and of amount of
accumulated energy per unit area, is energy
pyramid.

Similarly, pyramid of numbers can also be
sometimes inverted. e.g. if we plot the number
of insects on a single tree, smaller birds feeding
on insects, and parasites on those birds, we get
an inverted pyramid.

313

Use your brain power
What will happen, if in the above
example, we substitute larger bird of prey
feeding on small insect eating birds?

Pyramid of energy is always upright,
can never be inverted, because when energy
flows from a particular trophic level to the next
trophic level, some energy is always lost as
heat at each step. In smaller food chains, more
energy is available than in the longer food
chains.

Fig. 14.9 : Pyramid of Energy
There are certain limitations of
ecological pyramids. It assumes a simple food
chain, something that almost never exists in
nature. It does not accommodate a food web.
Moreover, saprophytes are not given any place
in ecological pyramids even though they play a
vital role in the ecosystem.
A given species may occupy more than
one trophic levels in the same ecosystem at
the same time, e.g. a sparrow is a primary
consumer when it eats seeds, fruits, peas, and
a secondary consumer when it eats insects and
worms.
14.4 Nutrient Cycles :
We have studied in earlier classes
that all organisms need a constant supply of
nutrients to grow, and reproduce. The amount of
nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus,
calcium, etc. present in the soil, varies in
different kinds of ecosystems on a seasonal
basis. These nutrients, which are never lost
from the ecosystems, are recycled indefinitely.
The movement of nutrient elements through

the various components of an ecosystem, is
called nutrient cycling. Another name of
nutrient cycling is biogeochemical cycle. Here,
essential elements are cycled from abiotic to
biotic world and back.
Types of Nutrient cycles : There are two types
of nutrient cycles viz. (a) gaseous and (b)
sedimentary. The reservoir for gaseous type of
nutrient cycle (e.g., nitrogen, carbon cycle) is
the atmosphere and for the sedimentary cycle
(e.g. phosphorus cycle) the reservoir is Earth’s
crust. The function of the reservoir is to meet
with the deficit, which occurs due to imbalance
in the rate of influx and efflux in any ecosystem.
Carbon Cycle :
All life forms on earth are carbon based
because carbon is the main component of
all the organic compounds of protoplasm. It
constitutes 49% of dry weight of organisms. If
we look at the total quantity of global carbon,
we find that 71% carbon is found dissolved in
oceans. This oceanic reservoir regulates the
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Fossil fuels

Fig. 14.10 : Carbon cycle
Carbon that is a part of rocks and fossil
fuels like oil, coal and natural gas, has been
away from the rest of the carbon cycle for a
long time. These long-term storage places

314

are known as “sinks”. When fossil fuels are
burned, carbon that had been underground is
released back into the air as carbon dioxide.
The element carbon is a part of seawater,
the atmosphere, rocks such as limestone and
coal, soils, as well as all living things.
• Carbon as CO2 moves from the atmosphere
to plants. Through the process of
photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is pulled
from the air to produce food.
• Carbon moves from plants to animals,
through food chains, i.e. the carbon present
in plants moves to the animals.
• Carbon moves from living things to the
atmosphere. Each time you exhale, you are
releasing carbon dioxide gas (CO2) into the
atmosphere.
• Decomposers also contribute substantially
to CO2 in atmosphere, by their processing of
waste materials and dead organic matter of
land and oceans.
• When fossil fuels burn to power factories,
power plants, motor vehicles, most of the
carbon quickly enters the atmosphere as
carbon dioxide gas. Each year, 5.5 billion
tons of carbon is released through combustion
of fossil fuels. Of this massive amount, 3.3
billion tons stays in the atmosphere. Most
of the remainder is dissolved in seawater
and deposited as calcium or magnesium
carbonate compounds which make up shells
of marine animals.
• Burning of wood, forest fire and combustion
of organic matter, fossil fuel and volcanic
activity, are additional sources for releasing
CO2 in the atmosphere.
• Carbon moves from the atmosphere to the
oceans. The oceans and other water bodies,
absorb some carbon in the form of CO2 from
the atmosphere. The carbon is dissolved into
the oceanic water. Some amount of the fixed
carbon is lost to sediments and removed
from circulation.

Fossil fuels represent a reservoir of
carbon. Carbon cycling occurs through
atmosphere, ocean and through living and
dead organisms. Human activities have
significantly influenced the carbon cycle.
• Rapid deforestation and massive burning
of fossil fuel for energy and transport, have
significantly increased the rate of release of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Thus, the entire carbon cycle is run
by basic processes viz. Photosynthesis,
Respiration, Decomposition, Sedimentation
and Combustion.
Phosphorus Cycle :
Cyclic movement of phosphorus through
hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere
constitutes phosphorus cycle.
Phosphorus is a major constituent of
biological membranes, nucleic acids and
cellular energy transfer systems. Many animals
also need large quantities of this element to
make shells, bones, hooves and teeth.
The natural reservoir of phosphorus is
rock, which contains phosphorus in the form of
phosphates. When rocks are weathered, minute
amounts of these phosphates dissolve in soil
solution and are absorbed by the roots of the
plants. Herbivores and other animals obtain
this element from plants. The waste products
and the dead organisms are decomposed by
phosphate-solubilizing bacteria releasing
phosphorus. Unlike carbon cycle, there is
no respiratory release of phosphorus into
atmosphere.
There are two major differences between
carbon and phosphorus cycle. Atmospheric
inputs of phosphorus through rainfall are much
smaller (meagure) than carbon inputs, and
secondly, exchanges of phosphorus between
organism and environment are negligible as
compare to carbon.
Unlike carbon and nitrogen, Phosphorus
is always in short supply and hence acts as

limiting factor for the plant growth. Sudden
influx of phosphorus in the form of agricultural
runoff or industrial effluents rich in phosphate
content, leads to eutrophication in water
bodies. Eutrophication is due to overgrowth
of algae at the instance of high phosphorus
disolved in water. The overgrowth of algae
kills or harms the aquatic life.
Internet my friend
What are the long term and short-term
effects of eutrophication in water bodies?
14.5 Ecological Succession :
Succession : It is a spatial pattern which occurs
over the time. Time is a crucial factor. The
ecosystem is occupied by the pioneer species.
As time passes, species diversity increase
giving way to more complex organisms.

Eventually, it leads to climax community.
Climax community does not evolve further.
The gradual and predictable change in the
species composition of a given area is called
ecological succession. The change is sequential
and environmentally regulated.
Process of succession involves sequential
steps like Nudation, Invasion, Ecesis,
Aggregation, Competition and co-action,
Reaction and stabilization.
During succession, some species colonize
an area and their populations become more
numerous, whereas populations of other species
decline and even disappear.
The entire sequence of communities that
successively change in a given area, constitute
what is called sere(s). Alternatively, it is an
entire gradient of organisms from pioneer stage
to climax stage.The individual transitional

316

communities are termed seral communities. In
the successive seral stages, there is a change in
the diversity of species of organisms, increase
in the number of species and organisms as well
as an increase in the total biomass.
The present day communities in the world
have come to be, because of succession that
has occurred over millions of years since life
started on earth. Succession is hence a process
that starts where no living organisms were
present before - like on a newly formed volcanic
island. This is called primary succession.
Other examples of areas where primary
succession occurs are newly cooled lava,
rocks and newly created pond or reservoir. The
establishment of a new biotic community is
generally very slow. Before a biotic community
of diverse organisms can become established,
there must be soil. Depending mostly on the
climate, it takes natural processes, several
hundred to several thousand years to produce
fertile soil on bare rock.
Secondary succession begins in areas where
natural biotic communities have been destroyed
such as in abandoned farm lands, burned or cut
forests, lands that have been flooded, etc. Since
some soil or sediment is present, succession is
faster than in primary succession. Description
of ecological succession usually focuses
on changes in vegetation. However, these
vegetational changes in turn affect food and
shelter for various types of animals. Thus, as
succession proceeds, the numbers and types of
animals and decomposers also change. At any
time during primary or secondary succession,
natural or human induced disturbances (fire,
deforestation, etc.), can convert a particular
seral stage of succession to an earlier previous /
preceding stage. Also, such disturbances create
new conditions that encourage some species
and discourage or eliminate other species.
Succession of Plants :
Based on the nature of the habitat – whether
it is water (or very wetland areas) or it is on
very dry areas – succession of plants, is called

hydrarch (hydrosere) or xerarch (xerosere),
respectively.
Hydrarch succession takes place in wetter
areas and the successional series progress from
hydric to the mesic conditions. As against this,
xerarch succession takes place in dry areas
and the series progress from xeric to mesic
conditions. Hence, both hydrarch and xerarch
successions lead to medium water conditions
(mesic) – neither too dry (xeric) nor too wet
(hydric).
The species that invade a bare area, are
called pioneer species. In primary succession
on rocks these are usually crustose lichens
which are able to secrete acids to dissolve
rock, helping in weathering of rocks and soil
formation. These pave the way for bryophytes,
mosses that are able to take hold in the small
amount of soil.
They are, with time, succeeded by
herbaceous plants, and after several more
stages, ultimately a stable climax forest
community is formed. The climax community
remains stable as long as the environment
remains unchanged.
In primary succession of aquatic habitat,
(steps 1 to 7 in fig. 14.13) the pioneers are
the small phytoplankton. They are replaced
with time by rooted-submerged plants (e.g.
Hydrilla), rooted-floating angiosperms (e.g.
Lotus) followed by free-floating plants (e.g.
Pistia), then reed swamp (e.g. Typha), marshmeadow (e.g. Cyperus), scrub (e.g. Alnus) and
finally the trees (e.g. Quercus). The climax
again would be a forest. With passage of time,
the water body is converted into land.
In secondary succession, the species that
invade depend on the condition of the soil,
availability of water, the environment as also
the seeds or other propagules present. Since
soil is already there, the rate of succession is
much faster and hence, climax is also reached
more quickly. Figure 14.14 shows the sequence
of stages 1 to 8 in a forest ecosystem after fire.

14.6 Ecosystem Services :
Healthy ecosystems are the base for a wide
range of economic, environmental and aesthetic
goods and services. The products of ecosystem
processes are named as ecosystem services,
for example, healthy forest ecosystems purify
air and water, mitigate droughts and floods.
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
report 2005 defines Ecosystem services as
benefits people obtain from ecosystems and
identifies four categories of ecosystem services
as follows.

6 Scrub stage

•

Supporting services include services such
as nutrient cycling, primary production, soil
formation, habitat provision and pollination
maintaining balance of ecosystem.

•

Provisioning services include food
(including seafood), raw materials
(including timber, skins, fuel wood), genetic
resources (including crop improvement
genes, and health care), water, medicinal
resources (including test and assay
organisms) and ornamental resources (furs,
feathers, ivory, orchids, butterflies, etc.)
Regulating services include Carbon
sequestration, Predation regulates prey
populations, Waste decomposition and
detoxification, Purification of water and air,
and pest control.

Fig. 14.13 : Hydrarch Succession of Plants
It is important to understand that succession,
particularly primary succession, is a very slow
process, maybe requiring thousands of years
for the climax to be reached.
Another important fact to understand is
that all the successions whether taking place in
water or on land, proceed to a similar climax
community – the mesic.

by an ecosystem. Photosynthetic activity of

form) from the atmosphere and releases O2 as a

byproduct. O2 not only purifies air but is also
used for respiration by all aerobes.
Pollination of plants brought about by
wind, water or other biotic agencies, is also an
important ecosystem service, without which
there would be no crops and no fruits.
Though the value of all such services of
biodiversity is difficult to determine, it seems
reasonable to think that biodiversity should
carry a hefty price tag.

Biodiversity, Conservation and Environmental Issues
Can you recall?

1. You have learnt about Chipko movement
and efforts of Shri. Jadav Payeng in
school. What is the importance of such
activities?
2. Why should we have national parks and
sanctuaries?
3. We have read about how Indian scientists
won the battle for patent of Turmeric and
Basmati rice. Why was gaining these
patents essential?
4. What is in situ and ex situ conservation?
Diversity is variety. This variety of life is
called biodiversity. Biodiversity includes a vast
array of species of microorganisms- viruses,
algae, fungi, plants and animals occurring on
Earth, either in terrestrial or aquatic habitat
and the ecological complexes of which they
are part.
The diversity is with respect to size
(microscopic to macroscopic), shape, colour,
form, mode of nutrition, type of habitat,
reproduction, motility, duration of life cycle
span, etc. This is actually due to the attempt
of living beings to accomodate with different
environmental conditions (like climatic,
edaphic, topographic, geographic, etc.)
or situations, solely for their survival and
perpetuation. In doing so, living organisms
adapt themselves to overcome different
situations and thus develop distinct but
different features and that has actually lead to
the diversity in them. The diversity in features
become infused in the life cycle. In short, these
adaptations in different environments serve as
basis for diversity.

Definition of Biodiversity : It is the part of
nature which includes the differences in the
genes among the individuals of a species; the
variety and richness of all plants and animal
species at different scales in a space - local
regions, country and the world; and the types of
ecosystem, both terrestrial and aquatic, within
a defined area.
The term biodiversity was actually coined
by Walter Rosen (1982) but the term was
popularised by sociologist Edward Wilson to
describe combined diversity at all the levels of
biological organisation.
Biodiversity that we see today, is the
outcome of over 3.5 billion of years of
evolutionary history mainly influenced by
natural processes and of late by influence of
humans.
In this chapter, we shall study the basic
concepts of biodiversity such as levels and
patterns of biodiversity, expanse, importance,
loss and conservation methods and efforts
undertaken.
15.1 Levels of Biodiversity:
Diversity of living world can be observed
at various levels, ranging from molecular
to ecosystem level. Major hierarchial and
interrelated levels are genetic diversity, species
diversity (community), and ecosystem diversity
(ecological).

321

Can you tell?
What can you say about species
diversity A and B?
A

B

a. Genetic diversity:
It is the intraspecific diversity. It is the
diversity in the number and types of genes
as well as chromosomes present in different
species and also the variation in the genes and
their alleles in the same species. It includes
variation within a population and diversity
between populations that are associated
with adaptation to local conditions. Genetic
variations (e.g. allelic genes) lead to individual
differences within species. Such variations pave
way to evolution. They also improve chances
of continuation of species in the changing
environmental conditions or allow the best
adapted to survive. Existence of subspecies,
races are examples of genetic diversity. Greater
the diversity, better would be sustenance of a
species. You know about 1000 varieties of
mangoes and 50,000 varieties of rice or wheat
in India.
Another case of genetic diversity is : a
medicinal plant Rauwolfia vomitoria which
secretes active component reserpine, is found
in different Himalayan ranges. This plant
shows variations in terms of potency and
concentration of active chemical, from location
to location.
Genetic diversity or variability is essential
for a healthy breeding population of a species.
b. Species diversity:
It is the interspecific diversity. The
number of species of plants and animals that
are present in a region, constitutes its species
diversity. Some areas or regions are richer
in species than in the other regions. Species
diversity deals with variety of species (species
richness) as well as number of individuals of
different species (species evenness) observed
in area under study. E.g. amphibian species
diversity is more in western ghats than in eastern
ghats. Natural undisturbed tropical forests have
much greater species richness than monoculture
plantation of timber plant, developed by forest
plantation. India is one among 15 nations that
are rich in species diversity.

c. Ecological (Ecosystem) diversity:
It is related to the different types
of ecosystems/ habitats within a given
geographical area. There are a large variety
of ecosystems on Earth having their own
complement of distinctive interlinked species,
based on the differences in the habitat. It
can be described for a specific geographical
region. Generally, there may be one or many
different types of ecosystems in a region. Thus,
ecosystem diversity is very high in India while
it is quite low in Norway. In India, we can find
a great variety of ecosystems - deserts, rain
forests, deciduous forests, estuaries, wetlands,
grasslands, etc. The Western ghats show great
ecosystem diversity while regions like Ladakh
and Rann of Kutch do not show variance like
we observe in Western ghats.
The diversity of life at all the three levels
is now rapidly being modified by modern
man.
15.2 Patterns of Biodiversity:
There are two patterns viz, Latitudinal
and Altitudinal gradient and species-area
relationship.
Think about it
What are latitudes and longitudes?
Which of these imaginary lines are more
significant with reference to diversification
of living beings? Why?
a. Latitudinal and altitudinal gradients :
Biodiversity, barring Arid/ Semiarid and
aquatic habitat, show latitudinal and altitudinal
gradient.
Latitudinal : Ecological studies have revealed
that the distribution of diversity is not uniform
around the Globe. Species richness exhibits
latitudinal gradient for many plants and
animals (if not all). It has been observed that
species richness is high at lower latitudes and
there is a steady decline towards the poles.

322

Altitudinal : It speaks for the height from mean
sea level (MSL) upwards. Species diversity
is more at lower altitudes than at the heigher
altitudes. It is because at heigher altitudes,
change in the climatic conditions and drastic
seasonal varitations, lead to the decrease in the
species diversity.
b. Species-Area relationships :
Scientists have tried to establish relationship
between species diversity and the size of the
habitat. It is considered that number of species
present is directly proportional to the area. It
is understood that larger areas may have more
resources that can be distributed amongst the
inhabitant species. Does this always hold true?

Species richness

Factors like overall stability of tropical
regions for millions of years, lesser climatic
changes throughout the year and availability
of plenty of sunlight that favoured speciation.
Tropical areas have less often experienced
drastic disturbances like periodic glaciations
observed at poles. Such a stability over millions
of years might have favoured speciation.
Lesser migrations in tropics might have
reduced gene flow between geographically
isolated regions and favoured speciation.
Scientists also have considered availability of
more intense sunlight, warmer temperatures
and higher annual rainfall in tropics, as factors
responsible for bountifulness of these regions.
In more or less constant climatic conditions
and abundance of resources, some animals
enjoy food preferences. For e.g. fruits being
available throughout the year in rain forests,
variety of frugivorous organisms is obviously
more as compared to the temperate regions.
In short, species richness or diversity for
plants and animals decreases as we move
away from equator to the poles. It is maximum
in tropical rain forests e.g. Amazon rain forest
(40,000 plants, 1300 birds, 427 mammals,
3000 species).

Area

Fig. 15.1 : Graph showing species area
relationship
Humboldt observed that species richness does
increase with the increase in area but upto
a limit. Observe the graph for species-area
relationship. For many species this curve is a
rectangular hyperbola. If we consider S to be
species richness, A as area under study, C as the
Y intercept and Z as the slope of the line, this
relationship can be described by the equation,
log S=log C+ Z log A.
On logarithmic scale this relationship is a
straight line, as observed in the figure above.
For smaller areas, value of Z ranges
between 0.1 to 0.2 regardless of species or
region under study.
But for the larger areas like the entire
continents, slopes are closer to vertical axis i.e.
steeper. This observation indicates that in very
large areas, number of species found, increase
faster than the area explored.
Can you tell?
1. What is biodiversity? Explain genetic
diversity with suitable example.
2. Species richness goes on decreasing as
we move from equator to pole. Explain.
Importance of species diversity to the
ecosystem:
Let us now understand whether we really
need all the diversity around us. What if few
species are lost permanently?

323

A community is said to be stable, if
average biomass production remains fairly
constant over a period of time. It should be
strong enough to withstand disturbances and
recover quickly. It also must be resistant to
invasive species. David Tillman carried out
various field experiments and proved that
species richness does help the stability of an
ecological community. Rich diversity leads to
lesser variation in biomass production over a
period of time. This is called ProductivityStability Hypothesis.
Paul Ehrlich, an ecologist from Stanford
gave an analogy to explain significance of
diversity. It is called Rivet Popper Hypothesis.
He compared Aeroplane to ecosystem and
the species as rivets that keep all parts of
the aeroplane together. Ofcourse, there are
thousands of rivets needed to hold all the parts
of the aeroplane together. If each passenger
decides to pop even one rivet or in other words,
if one species gets extinct, initially not much of
the turbulence will be experienced but slowly,
as number of popped rivets will increase, there
will be a serious threat to the safety of the
aeroplane. Also, which rivets are removed will
also matter.
Suppose, rivets at key positions such as
the ones that bind the wings to the body of the
aeroplane, are removed, situation will become
serious. Thus, we can say that relationship
between diversity and well being of ecosystem
is not linear. But it is certain that loss of species
may not pose threat to the ecosystem only
initially. Loss of key species will certainly
cause threat in very short span of time. It will
affect food chains, food web, energy flow,
natural cycles, etc. In short it will affect the
balace of ecosystem.
15.3 Biodiversity Current Scenario
How many species do really exist on earth
and how many of them are found in India? It is
difficult to come to consensus about the exact

number of species that are present on earth
today. Though over 1.5 million species have
been documented as per IUCN data (2004) so
far, we are yet to study lot more than these. We
are also unaware about speciation process that
might have continued. Most of the studies that
have been carried out are in temperate regions.
Tropical rain forests, the major diversity
hubs, are yet to be explored completely. Some
exorbitant numbers like existence of 20 to 50
million varieties have been made. But Robert
May has given convincing estimate of about
7 million species round the globe. Observe
the given pie charts and find out the relative
share of various plant and animal groups in the
existing knowledge of biodiversity.

In the diagrams, we do not find any data
of prokaryotes. Several moneran species are
not cultivable under laboratory conditions.
Also, conventional taxonomic methods are
not suitable for identification of prokaryotic
species.
India boasts a handsome share of 8.1% of
total biodiversity wealth of the earth. One of the
12 megadiversity countries of the globe, India
has 2.4% of total land area of the world. We
have identified around 45000 plant species and
nearly double the number of animal varieties
from our natural wealth. If we consider May’s
estimate of global biodiversity, we have
recorded only 22% of our natural wealth. This
situation underlines the need of taxonomists
to study the biodiversity. But major concern is
the possibility of loss of these varieties before
we identify them because of activities like
reclamation and deforestation.
Do you know ?
Recently a group of naturalists proved
that a lizard from Amboli ghat of Maharashtra
was misidentified. They proved it on the basis
of DNA profiling as well as number of glands
and scales present on the legs of the lizard.
Earlier thought to be Hemidactylus brookii,
the lizard is now renamed as Hemidactylus
varadgirii in the honour of renowned
herpetologist and conservationist, Dr. Varad
Giri. They also proved that brookii variety is
not found in India.

about natural wealth is conserved.

15.4 Loss of Biodiversity:
Loss of biodiversity leads to the overall
imbalance in the ecosystem. The chief serious
aspect of loss of biodiversity is extinction of
species. There are three types of extinction viz,
natural extinction, mass extinction and manmade (anthropogenic) extinction.
Damage to biodiversity takes place due to
both, natural and manmade reasons. Natural
reasons include forest fires, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions etc. Manmade reasons
are habitat destruction, hunting, settlement,
overexploitation and reclamation.
Major mass extinction events occured
between Cretaeous and Coenozoic period;
between Triassic and Jurassic period;
between Permian and Triassic period;
between Devonian and Carbaniferous period;
between Ordovician and Silurian period in
the geological time scale where plants as well
as animal groups underwent mass extinction.
We are aware of five mass extinctions
during various stages of history of earth (e.g.
ice age). The current loss of biodiversity is
considered to be the Sixth extinction which
is progressing at an alarming rate which is
estimated to be 100 to 1000 times faster than
prehuman times. Ecologists blame this to
the human intervention in natural habitats.
They do not forget to warn that if the current
trend continues, we might lose about 50% of
diversity. Loss of biodiversity in any area
can lead to the decline in plant production,
lower resilience to environmental disturbance
like flood. It may also lead to alteration in
environmental processes like disease cycles,
plant productivity etc.
Causes of Biodiversity losses:
There are four major causes popularly
known as, ‘The Evil Quartet’.
i. Habitat loss and fragmentation:
It is the prime cause of destruction.
Reduction in vast natural habitats and local
degradation by pollution, create crisis situation
for the living beings. Loss of local habitat due

325

to human activities, creates threat to migratory
birds as well as those animals that need larger
territories. Tropical rain forests are being lost
at an alarming rate. Tropical rain forest cover
has reduced from 14% to 6% over the years.

resources which in turn causes threats to various
organisms. Can you corelate this with dirth
of fish, we observe now a days? Dodo bird,
stellar sea cow and passenger pigeon are few
examples of extinction due to overexploitation.
iii. Alien species invasion:

Do you know ?
Great Indian Bustard alias Maldhok is
a critically endangered bird. It is considered
as flagship species of grasslands. We lost last
Maldhok from Maharashtra in 2018. Now this
bird is found in Rajasthan and Gujrat. It is
an example of local extinction due to habitat
loss and hunting.
ii. Over-exploitation:
Basic difference between human beings
and other animals is that, humans have the
tendency to accumulate beyond their needs.
This has resulted in the overexploitation of

When a new species gets introduced into
any ecosystem accidentally or intentionally,
there are chances that it proves harmful for
existing species. Sometimes, it can lead to
extinction of local species. In such a case, it is
called as invasive species. E.g. the carrot grass
(Parthenium), Lantana and water hyacinth
(Eichhornia). Introduction of predator fish Nile perch in Lake Victoria, proved deleterious
for 200 local species of Cichlid fish.
In India, introduction of African catfish
Clarias gariepinus for aquaculture purpose has
proved harmful to endemic catfish varieties.
One of the major reasons of such a harmful
effect of alien species is, lack of local predator.
iv. Co-extinctions:
Many a times, organisms are associated
with each other in obligatory way. In such
cases, extinction of one variety leads to loss
of associate variety from the ecosystem. e.g.,
Extinction of host fish causes extinction of
unique parasites. Coevolved plant-pollinator,
also will have such a threat.

a. Dodo bird

b. Stellar sea cow

c. Passenger pigeon

We are aware of threat to diversity and
loss of species from earth. When any species
is totally eliminated from earth, it is called
extinct. e.g. Dinosaurs. When the number of
members of a species starts dwindling, it is said
to be endangered. The International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources
(IUCN) maintains a Red Data Book also
known as Red List, where conservation status
of plant and animal species is recorded.

over-exploitation

Internet my friend
What is ballast water and how can it bring
about introduction of alien species into any
ecosystem?
Do you know ?
Many a times, we read about leopard
attacks on humans or about elephants
from Karnataka destroying agricultural
lands and orchards in Sindhudurg region
of Maharashtra. With increase in human
population, man started encroaching forest
land. Animals either out of sheer curiosity
(in case of young leopards) or for lack of
sufficient resources, venture out from their
original place. This results in Man-Animal
conflict.
Various measures are adapted by
forest department to minimise this tussle.
e.g., Government not only gives monetary
compensation to farmers affected by elephant
attacks, but even the forest department
conducts community meetings to train
locals to face the attack. Also, measures like
appointing experts to tame the wild elephants
with the help of domesticated elephants, and
sensitising people towards wild life are most
important part of such activities.
Do you know ?
The IUCN system uses a set of five
quantitative criteria to assess the extinction
risk of a given species. These criteria are : The
rate of population decline; The geographic
range; Whether the species already possesses
a small population size; Whether the species
is very small or lives in a restricted area;
and Whether the results of a quantitative
analysis indicate a high probability of
extinction in the wild.

After a given species has been thoroughly
evaluated, it is placed into one of following
several categories.
1. Extinct (EX), a designation applied to
species in which the last individual has
died or is not recorded.
2. Extinct in the Wild (EW), a category
containing those species whose members
survive only in captivity
3. Critically Endangered (CR), a category
containing those species that possess an
extremely high risk of extinction with very
few surviving members (50).
4. Endangered (EN), a designation applied
to species that possess a very high risk of
extinction as a result of rapid population
decline of 50 to more than 70 percent over
the previous 10 years (or three generations).
5. Vulnerable (VU), a category containing
those species that possess a very high risk
of extinction as a result of rapid population
decline of 30 to more than 50 percent over
the previous 10 years (or three generations).
6. Near Threatened (NT), a designation
applied to species that are close to becoming
threatened or may meet the criteria for
threatened status in the near future.
7. Least Concern (LC), a category containing
species that are pervasive and abundant
after careful assessment
8. Data Deficient (DD), a condition applied
to species in which the amount of available
data related to its risk of extinction, is
lacking in some way.
9. Not Evaluated (NE), a category used to
include any of the nearly 1.9 million species
described by scientists, but not assessed by
the IUCN

15.5 Conservation of Biodiversity :
Conservation of biodiversity means
protection,
upliftment
and
scientific
management of biodiversity to maintain
its optimum level and to derive sustainable
benefits for the present and future strategies.
Why to conserve Diversity?
The reasons for conservation of biodiversity
can be classified into three categories:
a. Narrowly utilitarian reasons:
Since time immemorial, humans are
reaping material benefits from biodiversity.
It may be deriving resources for basic needs
such as food, clothes, shelter or industrial
products like resins, tannins, perfume base etc.
For aesthetic use as in ornaments or artefacts.
Medicinal use of plants and animals, is another
major factor. It shares 25% of global medicine
market. Around 25000 species are put to use
by tribals worldwide as traditional medicines.
Several are yet to be explored for their potential
as medicinal plants.
Nowadays bioprospecting of economically
important species is carried out. Bioprospecting
is systematic search for development of
new sources of chemical compounds, genes,
micro-organisms, macro-organisms, and other
valuable products from nature.
b. Broadly utilitarian reasons:
If we find out the cost of oxygen cylinder
and try to calculate the value of oxygen we
breathe with such ease; we will understand
what nature is giving us for free! Animals play
a crucial role in pollination and seed dispersal.
Amazon forest is estimated to produce 20%
of total oxygen of earths atmosphere. We need
to consider recreational use of diversity too.
You must have come across the news
about devastating fires in amazon rainforest in
August 2019.
These are mainly caused in Brazil and
are more manmade than natural. The slash

and burn policy of locals to reclaim forestland
has caused a towering 906000 hectares of
forest devastation, only in the year 2019. We
the humans, need to rethink about our attitude
towards nature!
c. Ethical reasons:
We have no right to destroy the diversity
simply because we share the earth with them!
All living beings have equal right to survive
irrespective of their known or prospective
economic use.
Internet my friend
Visit www.gotul.org.in to find out
information about various efforts for
biodiversity conservation in Maharashtra.
How do we conserve biodiversity?
Conservation means sustainable use of
natural resources. There are two main types of
conservation strategies :
a. In situ conservation:
Protection of an organism will automatically
takes place, if its natural habitat is protected.
e.g. Announcing Kanha forest as tiger reserve.
This is called in situ conservation. This is the
most appropriate method of conservation. It is
nothing but conservation ‘at home’. Around
34 Biodiversity hotspots have been identified
by the conservationists. These are the regions
with high species richness as well as density.
These areas need to be protected strategically
by setting legislative measures apart from
awareness and conservation.
In situ conservation also includes
introduction of varieties traditionally
used into farming and horticulture. E.g. In
Maharashtra, Pawra tribals in Satpuda have
protected varieties of corn with different
coloured kernels.

328

India has three of world’s biodiversity
hotspots (the areas with high density of
biodiversity), Western ghats, Indo-Burma
and Eastern-Himalayas. It has been estimated
that protection of these diversity rich hotspots
could reduce extinction rate by almost 30%.
India, at present has 14 biosphere reserves,
90 national parks and 448 wildlife sanctuaries.
In Maharashtra, there are 5 national parks and
11 sanctuaries.

areas, biosphere reserves, national parks
and wild life sanctuaries.
Can you recall?
What are sacred groves?
Indian culture and traditions are always
connected with nature and rituals are laid
down to protect biodiversity. In many cultures,
stretches of forests were set aside and protected
in the name of Almighty, which are called
sacred groves.
Such sacred groves are found in Khasi
and Jaintia hills in Meghalaya, Western ghat
regions of Maharashtra and Karnataka, Aravali
hills of Rajasthan and Bastar, and Chanda and
Sarguja areas of Madhya Pradesh.

Sacred groves serve the only chance of
survival for some endangered varieties of
animal and plant species. Tribals do not allow
to cut even a single branch of tree from sacred
grove. But with the increasing lust and greed,
are sacred groves safe? We must think about it.
b. Ex situ conservation:
Sometimes when a species is critically
endangered, special measures have to be under
taken to protect it. It might be protected in
captivity, as one of the measures of protection.
This is called Ex situ conservation. In this type
of conservation, living beings are protected
away from their natural habitats in special
settings. Wild life safari parks, zoological
parks and botanical gardens serve this purpose.
Animals which have decreased in number, are
allowed to breed in captivity in order to protect
them.Eg crocodile bank of Chennai.
Seed banks are established to conserve wild
varieties of food grains and vegetables. Now a
days, modern techniques like tissue culture, in
vitro fertilization of eggs and cryopreservation
(preservation at low temperature -1960C)
of gametes, are used to protect endangered
species.
By now we have, thus, understood the
immense importance of biodiversity and dire
need to protect it.

Do you know ?

Dr. Akira Miyawaki studied native forests of Japan especially
the old shrine groves and developed a technique of growing dense plantations in short time. It is
a technique for restoration of natural vegetation on degraded land. In this technique, after soil
testing, the landmass is dugout and soil is mixed with local biomass and humus. Plantation is
done in layers and saplings are planted close to each other. Due to this, sunlight doesn’t reach
soil retaining the moisture. Close proximity of plants leads to faster vertical growth than lateral.
Also, it promotes natural selection. Native varieties are planted and the forest develops at almost
ten times faster than the natural way. It requires a caring period of 3 years after which it grows
and develops its own diversity naturally. In India, this technique is adapted at several places
including remote districts like Chandrapur as well as metro cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru.
Though there is debate about feasibility of the technique, it is certainly helping in retaining and
recharging groundwater table, supporting local biodiversity and curbing air pollution by adding
to green cover.

on Biological Diversity (CBD-1992).
In order to provide framework for the
sustainable management and conservation of
our country’s natural resources, government
passed Biological Diversity Act (BD Act) in
the year 2002 in compliance with CBD. The
law broadly defines biodiversity, as plants,
animals and microorganisms and their parts,
their genetic materials and by-products. It
excludes value added products and human
genetic material.
Regulation of access to Indian biological
resources as well as scientific cataloguing of
traditional knowledge about ethnobiological
materials, were the main objectives for
proposing this act.
A three-tier system has been established with
National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) at the
national level, the State Biodiversity Boards
(SBBs) at the state level, and Biodiversity
Management Committees (BMCs) at the
local level for approval of utilization of any
biological resource for commercial or research
purpose. It is mandatory for foreigners, NRIs
as well as Indian citizens and institutions to
seek permission from NBA before exploiting
local resource. NBA has powers of civil court.
Not seeking approval of NBA, can incur jail
and fine up to 10 lakh rupees.

Any substance that causes pollution, is
called Pollutant. In order to protect and improve
the quality of our environment, the Government
of India has passed the Environment Protection
Act 1986.
a. Air Pollution :
Effect of air pollution :
Respiratory surfaces of living beings
are constantly interacting with air. Any
unfavourable alteration in air quality, affects
the respiratory system. Severity of damage
depends on concentration of pollutant,
duration of exposure and the organism. Even
in case of plants, air pollution results in poor
yield of crops and premature death of plants.
Nowadays automobiles are omnipresent. They
are major cause for atmospheric (air) pollution.
Regular maintenance of vehicles and use of
lead-free petrol or diesel can reduce pollutant
from exhausts.
Types of air pollutants :
Air pollutants are of two types – particulate
pollutants and gaseous pollutants.
Particulate air pollutants may be solid
or liquids. Particles with diameter 10 µm may
settle in the soil but particles with 1 µm or
less remain suspended in the air. According
to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB),
particulate matter of size 2.5µm or less in
diameter (PM2.5) are responsible for causing
the greatest harm to humans.
These fine particulates can be inhaled deep
into the lungs and are responsible for irritation,
inflammation and damage to lungs. In addition
to this, it causes breathing and respiratory
disorders and premature deaths.
Smoke, smog, pesticides, heavy metals,
dust and radioactive elements are the examples
of particulate pollutants.
Use your brain power
Does particulate matter help to reduce
atmospheric temperature?

Gaseous pollutants include CO2, CO, SO2,
NO, NO2 etc.
Carbon di-oxide is a greenhouse gas.
In the past, levels of CO2 in the atmosphere
remained low. Due to burning of fossil fuels,
as well as increasing deforestation the levels of
CO2 are rising at alarming rate. Photosynthesis
process balances CO2 : O2 ratio of the air to
a great extent. CO2 is also removed from the
air by weathering of silicate rocks forming
limestone. A jet plane in a single trip across the
Atlantic uses 35 tonnes of oxygen and releases
70 tonnes of CO2. We are going to discuss the
role of CO2 in global warming later in this
chapter.
Carbon monoxide (CO) :
It is a poisonous gas produced by
incomplete combustion of fuel such as coal or
wood. Vehicular exhausts are the largest source
of CO.
Use your brain power
State the effects of CO on human body.
Nitrogen di oxide (NO2) and nitrogen
monoxide (NO):
These are released by automobiles and
chemical industries as waste gases. NO2 when
combines with water vapours forms nitric acid.
It causes irritation to eyes and lungs. At high
concentration, it causes injury to lungs, liver
and kidneys.
Control measures:
Various ingenious mechanisms have been
developed to control emission of gaseous and
particulate pollutants through vehicles and
industries. Few examples are explained below:
Electrostatic precipitator :
It is most widely used for removing
particulate matter like soot and dust present in
industrial exhaust. It can remove almost 99%
particulate matter present in exhaust from a
thermal power plant.

In this method, high voltage is applied
and electric discharge takes place which
causes ionisation of air in the smokestack.
Free electrons in the ionised air get attached
to the gaseous/dust particles moving up the
stack. These negatively charged particles
move towards the positive electrode and settle
down there. These particles are removed by
vibrations of the electrodes and collected in the
reservoir.

Find out information about carbon foot
print. Think about measures to reduce your
own carbon foot print.
Exhaust gas Scrubbers are used to clean air
for both dust and gases by passing it through
dry or wet packing material. It can remove
gases like SO2. In the scrubber, the exhaust is
passed through a spray of water or lime.

Controlling Vehicular Air Pollution : A case
study of Delhi
In the year 1990, Delhi ranked fourth
among 41 most polluted cities of the world.
In response to PIL (Public Interest Litigation),
Supreme court of India sent orders to Delhi
government to take appropriate actions.
In response, several measures were taken by
Delhi Government. By 2002, all the city buses
were converted to run on CNG (compressed
natural gas). CNG is advantageous over other
fuels because it is economic, burns efficiently
and is adulteration proof fuel.
According to new fuel policy, the norms
are set to reduce sulphur and aromatic content
of petrol and diesel. Another provision is
upgradation of engines. For this, Bharat
stage emission standards (BS) are set. These
standards are equivalent to Euro norms and
have evolved on similar lines as Bharat Stage
II (BS II) to BS VI from 2001 to 2017. Let us
observe how the norms have changed in the
following table 15.7

Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala yojana
(Pradhan Mantri clean fuel programme)
It was launched by Prime Minister of
India, on 1st May 2016 to distribute 50 million
LPG connections to women of BPL families.
In many BPL families, chullhas are used
where incomplete combustion of wood and
coal leads to CO poisoning. Use of LPG helps
in reducing such household air pollution.

Do you know ?
Inspite of all the measures, New
Delhi and adjoining areas witnessed great
smog between 1st to 9th November 2016. Air
pollution at this time peaked on both 2.5PM
and 10PM levels. This is reported as one of
the worst levels of air quality since 1999.
Colder weather and stagnant winds, trap
smoke from various sources like firecrackers,
burning crop stubbles, lit garbage and road
dust. Citizens suffered breathlessness, chest
muscle contraction, irritation in eyes, asthma
and allergy. Administration took certain
measures like closing educational institutions,
suspending of construction or demolition
work, undertaking vacuum cleaning of roads
etc. Even Badarpur thermal power plant was
temporarily closed down. Do you think mere
setting standards is not enough? We must
encourage means like car pooling and use of
public transport.
Can you tell?

Have you noticed that BS V is missing in
above table? Note that, in 2001, Bharat stage
II emission norms were set for CNG and LPG
vehicles. It stipulates that emission of sulphur
be controlled at 50 ppm in diesel and 150ppm
in petrol. Aromatic hydrocarbons should be just
42% in concerned fuel. The aim is to reduce
sulphur emission to 50ppm in petrol and diesel
along with aromatic hydrocarbons to 35%.
Government of India directly adapted BS VI
in the year 2018, skipping BS V. These efforts
decreased the levels of CO2 and SO2 in Delhi.

1. Describe any 2 particulate and gaseous
pollutants.
2. Explain various technologies used for
removing particulate matter from different
sources of air pollution.
3. What are the ill effects of noise pollution
on human health?
4. Give any norms for reducing sulphur and
aromatic contents of petrol and diesel.
b. Noise pollution :
In India, the Air (Prevention and control
of pollution) Act 1981, amendment 1987,
includes noise as an air pollutant. Noise is an
undesired high level of sound. Noise causes
psychological and physiological changes in
human beings. There is dire need of creating
awareness about noise pollution caused during
festivals and processions in our society.

333

Exposure to extremely high sound level
(150 decibels or more) generated during a takeoff of a jet plane or rocket, may damage ear
drums and cause permanent hearing loss.
Noise also can cause sleeplessness,
increased heartbeat, altered breathing pattern
and psychological stress. Noise may negatively
interfere with child’s learning and behaviour
pattern. The common sources of noise pollution
are machines, transportation, construction
sites, industries etc.

Activity :

Increased utilisation and discharge of harmful
waste water in water bodies has caused severe
pollution.
Most of the water pollution is manmade.
Polluted water may be turbid, foul smelling,
and may contain number of pathogens, heavy
metals, oils etc.
Realising the importance of maintaining
the cleanliness of the water bodies, Government
of India has passed the Water (prevention and
control of pollution) Act 1974 to safe guard
our water resources.

Find out different sources of noise
pollution in your surrounding.

Can you recall?

Reduction of noise in our industries can
be brought about by use of sound absorbent
materials or by muffling the noise. Laws which
prohibit blowing horn in the areas of schools
and hospitals, need to be implemented strictly
to curb decibel levels.
Govt. of India has rules and regulations
against firecrackers and loudspeakers. Supreme
court of India has banned loudspeakers at
public gatherings after 10pm.

1. Where does domestic waste water go in
urban and rural areas?
2. What is importance of sewage treatment
plant?
Domestic sewage and Industrial Effluents:
Even a small quantity of about 0.1%
impurities in water, can make it unfit for
human consumption. Solids are relatively easy
to separate but dissolved salts such as nitrates,
phosphates, other nutrients and toxic metal ions
as well as organic compounds, are difficult to
remove.
Domestic sewage is one of the most
common source of water pollution. It contains
biodegradable organic matter. It readily
gets decomposed by bacteria and other
microorganisms. They use organic matter as
substrate and utilise some amount of sewage.

We have studied about health effects of
noise pollution on humans. How does this
pollution affect birds? Does it affect marine
life? Find out.
Can you recall?
1. Define water pollution.
2. When will you call a water body polluted?
c. Water Pollution and its Control:
Water has been a controlling factor in
distribution and density of living beings in an
area. Human water consumption increased
many folds with increased industrialisation.

It is possible to estimate biodegradable
organic matter in sewage water by measuring
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). It is
the amount of dissolved oxygen required by
microorganisms for decomposing the organic
matter present in water. It is expressed in
milligram of oxygen per litre (mg/L) of water.
High BOD indicates intense level of microbial
pollution.

334

Microorganisms involved in biodegradation
of organic matter in water body consume lot
of dissolved oxygen. This results in sharp
decline in oxygen level of water which leads
to mortality of fish and other aquatic creatures.

Stinking eutrophic lake with coloured and turbid
water

Presence of large amount of nutrients in
water causes excessive growth of planktonic
free-floating algae specially, blue green algae.
This is called algal bloom which gives colour
to the water bodies. Algal bloom often releases
toxins in water. So, fish die due to toxicity.
Quality of water deteriorates and becomes
toxic for human beings and other animals.

Death of aquatic animals including fish

Another threat to aquatic ecosystem, is
water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). It is
an aquatic plant, native of amazon basin,
highly problematic invasive species. It was
first introduced in India for its lovely purple
coloured flowers. But, now it is a nuisance as
it grows excessively and covers entire water
body. This plant grows faster than our ability
to remove it. It is commonly called ‘Terror of
Bengal’.
Natural Eutrophication is aging of a lake
due to nutrient enrichment of water. Depending
on the size of the lake, climatic conditions and
other factors, natural aging of lakes require
thousands of years. However, due to pollutants
from human activities like effluents from
agricultural lands, industries and homes (house
hold) have accelerated this aging process. This
phenomenon is called Cultural or Accelerated
Eutrophication. Observe the flow chart and
understand the process of eutrophication.
This results in non-availability of dissolved
oxygen for aquatic organisms. This leads to
death of fish and other aquatic organisms. Its
decomposition further depletes the dissolved
oxygen. So, a lake can literally get choked to
death.
A few substances usually present in
industrial waste waters can undergo biological
magnification. The phenomenon through which

Fig. 15.9 : Biomagnification of DDT
Many of the pesticides are non-degradable.
So, they get accumulated in the tissues of
organisms. They neither get metabolised nor
are excreted.

335

They are passed on to the next trophic
level. This is commonly seen in case of DDT
and Mercury. Observe the food chain in the
given figure. It shows how biomagnification of
DDT takes place.
Use your brain power
Why do you think the amount of DDT
is maximum in birds?
Thermal pollution of water is caused
due to rise in temperature of water. The main
source of thermal pollution are the thermal
and nuclear power plants. The power plants
use water as coolant and release hot water. As
many organisms are sensitive to temperature,
sudden rise in temperature leads to loss of flora
and fauna.

When the pit of an ecosan toilet fills up, it
is closed and sealed. After about 8-9 months,
the faeces are completely composted to organic
manure.There are working EcoSan toilets in
many areas of Gujrat, Kerala, Tamilnadu and
Sri Lanka.
Recycling of sewage water by reverse
osmosis will help to solve the problem of not
only scarcity of water but also the disposal of
sewage water. At Tirumala hills, millions of
pilgrims visit. Every building here has R.O.
system which solves the problem of huge
water demand. Recycling of sewage water
is seen in many townships in Mumbai. Rain
water harvesting is encouraged and made
mandatory for new constructions by Municipal
Corporation.
Can you tell?
1. Explain BOD and its effects on aquatic
ecosystem.
2. Ecological sanitation is the need of the
day. Justify.
3. Explain the phenomenon of biological
magnification.

1. Find out biomagnification of diclofenac
and DDT in birds.
2. Find out various types of agrochemicals
which have ill effects on ecosystem.
Measures to reduce sewage water:
In order to conserve water and prevent
creation of sewage, ecosan is a sustainable
system for handling human excreta using dry
composting toilets. This is a practical, efficient
and cost-effective solution for human waste
disposal.
Ecological sanitation (Ecosan) is an approach
to sanitation provision which safely reuses
excreta in agriculture. It reduces the need for
chemical fertilizers.
Ecosan toilet is a closed system that does
not need water. It is an alternative to leach pit
toilets in place where water is scarce or where
there is risk of ground water contamination.
It is based on the principle of recovery and
recycling of nutrients from excreta to create a
valuable resource for agriculture.

Solid Waste Management :
You have already studied about solid waste
management in ninth standard.
Can you recall?
1. Why is it necessary to separate wet and
dry garbage?
2. What are the six R’s to combat solid
waste?
Solid waste is everything that goes to trash.
It includes wastes from home, offices, stores,
schools, hospitals etc. Wastes are collected
and disposed by municipality. Municipal solid
waste generally consists of paper, food, plastic,
glass, metals, rubber, leather, textile etc;
Burning reduces volume of the waste.
Generally, it is not burnt to completion. So
open dumps become breeding ground for rats
and flies.

336

Sanitary landfills are substitute for open
burning dumps. Here wastes are dumped in
depression or trench. Everyday wastes are
added to this pit. Landfills get filled very
soon especially in metro cities. The amount of
garbage generated is too high. In addition to
this, there is a danger of chemicals percolating
and reaching down to ground water and
contaminate this water source.
All wastes can be categorised in three
types1. Bio degradable
2. Recyclable
3. Non bio degradable
Our rag pickers and kabadiwallahs do
a great job of separation of materials for
recycling. Primary goal of all citizens should
be to reduce generation of waste.
The biodegradable materials can be put
into deep pits in the ground and left for natural
degradation. Non biodegradable wastes have
to be disposed off.

Such wastes require careful treatment and
disposal. You are aware of colour code for
disposal of biomedical waste.
Irreparable computers and other electronic
goods as well as electrical waste are known
as e wastes. They are buried in landfills or
are completely burnt. Major part of e waste
generated by developed countries are exported
to developing countries like China, India and
Pakistan. During recycling process of this
waste, metals like copper, iron, silicon, nickel
and gold are recovered. Developed countries
have facilities for recycling of e waste. In
developing countries, manual participation
is involved. So, workers are exposed to toxic
substances from e waste. Treatment of e waste
should be carried out in environment friendly
manner.
You have already studied about radioactive
pollution.

1. What is greenhouse effect?
2. Enlist greenhouse gases.
3. How do you corelate green house effect
and global warming?

Can you recall?

15.8 Greenhouse effect and Global warming:
Greenhouse effect : It is responsible for heating
of earth’s surface and atmosphere. Without
greenhouse effect, the average temperature
of Earth would have been -180C rather than
average of 150C.

Hospitals generate harmful waste that
contains disinfectants, harmful chemicals and
also pathogenic microorganisms.

Of the solar radiation that reaches earth,
Clouds and gases reflect about 1/4th and absorb
some of it. But half of total incoming radiations
reach the earth’s surface and heat it. Small
portion of it, is reflected back. Earth’s surface re
emits the heat in the form of infrared radiations.
Part of these radiations do not escape into the
space because atmospheric gases (CO2, CH4)
absorb a major portion.

This rise in temperature leads to

The atmosphere around the earth acts as which may be the cause for submerging of the
glass wall of a greenhouse. It absorbs solar coastal areas.
radiations from the sun and radiates it to
earth. Atmosphere prevents infrared radiations
emitted by the earth to escape into the space.
Gases responsible for this effect are
carbon di-oxide (CO2), Methane (CH4),
chloroflorocarbons (CFC), Nitrous oxide (N2O)
and water vapours.
Because of burning of fossil fuels in
industries, by automobiles, burning of
agricultural wastes, levels of CO2 are increasing.
Biogas plants, paddy fields, cattle sheds add
methane to atmosphere. Chloroflorocarbons
are emitted by fire extinguishers and air
conditioners.
Global warming :
Increase in atmospheric concentration of
green house gases, has resulted in the heating
of Earth or rise in the temperature. During
past century, the temperature of the Earth has
increased by 0.60C, most of it during last three
decades.
338

Do you know ?
In order to overcome the problem
of global warming, Chewang Norphel, Ice
Man of India has built 13 artificial glaciers.
He is an Indian civil engineer from Ladakh.
Norphel noticed a small stream had
frozen solid, under the shade of a group of
poplar trees, though it flowed freely elsewhere
in his yard.
The reason for this phenomenon :
The flowing water was moving
quickly to freeze while the sluggish trickle
of water beneath the trees, was slow enough
to freeze. Based on this, he created artificial
glaciers by diverting a river into a valley,
slowing the stream by constructing checks.
The artificial glaciers increase the
ground water recharge, rejuvenating the
spring and providing water for irrigation.
He constructed them at lower elevations, so
that they melt earlier expanding the growing
season.

Global warming can be controlled by
reducing use of fossil fuel, improving efficiency
of energy usage, reducing deforestation,
planting trees and checking of human
population growth.
Do you know ?
El Nino effect is a climate cycle in
pacific ocean with global impact on weather
pattern. The cycle begins when warm water
in the western tropical pacific ocean shifts
eastwards along the equator towards the
coast of America. Normally, this warm water
pools near Indonesia and Philippines.
La Nina is a climatic pattern that
describes the cooling of surface ocean
waters along the tropical west coast of south
America.
15.9 Ozone depletion :
Ozone is a form of oxygen.In the
stratosphere, ozone is photo-dissociated and is
generated by absorption of short wave length
UV radiations.
O3 → O2 +[O]
O2+ [O] → UV RAYS → O3
Generation and dissociation of ozone are in
equilibrium leading to steady concentration of
ozone in the stratosphere (12 to 15 kilometers
from Earth’s surface in the atmosphere).
This ozone layer acts as shield that absorbs
UV radiations from the sun and protects
all types of life on earth. Absorption of UV
radiations by ozone blanket is proportional
to its thickness. Thickness is more above the
poles than at the equator. UV rays are highly
injurious to living organisms since DNA and
proteins of living organisms absorb UV rays
and its high energy breaks the chemical bonds
within these molecules.
Thickness of the ozone in a column of air
from the ground to the top of the atmosphere is
measured as Dobson units (DU).

The ozone shield has been disturbed due
to increased rate of ozone degradation by
Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). CFCs move
upwards and reach stratosphere. UV rays act on
them and release Cl atoms. Cl degrades ozone
releasing molecular oxygen. Cl atoms act as
catalyst. So they remain in the stratosphere and
continue the effect of ozone degradation. This
results in ozone depletion. Although it occurs
widely in the stratosphere, the depletion is
particularly marked over the Antarctic region.
This has resulted in formation of large area of
thinned ozone layer, commonly called ozone
hole.
UV radiations of wave length shorter than
UV-B i.e. 100-280nm are almost completely
absorbed by earth’s atmosphere, given that
the ozone layer is intact. UV-B (wavelength
280-322nm) damages DNA and mutation
may occur. It causes aging of skin, damage to
skin cells and various types of skin cancers. In
human eye, cornea absorbs UV-B radiations
and a high dose of UV-B causes inflammation
of cornea called snow blindness, cataract
etc; Such exposure may permanently damage
cornea.
Recognising the harmful effects of ozone
depletion, an international treaty, known as the
Montreal Protocol was signed at Montreal
(Canada) in 1987 to control emission of ozone
depleting substances.
Later many more efforts have been made
and protocols have laid down definite roadmaps
separately for developing and developed
countries for reducing emission of CFCs and
other ozone depleting chemicals.

15.10 Deforestation :
Deforestation is conversion of forest area
into non-forest area. According to an estimate,
almost 40% forests are lost in the tropics and
only 1% in temperate region. The scenario of
deforestation is grim in India. At the beginning
of 20th century, forest cover was about 30% in
India. By the end of the century, it got reduced
to 19.4 %. The National Forest Policy 1988 of
India has recommended 33% forest cover for
the plains and 67% for the hills.
Deforestation takes place by conversion
of forest to agricultural land so as to feed the
growing human population.Trees are cut for
timber, firewood, for keeping cattle in farm and
for other purposes.
Slash and burn agriculture commonly
called Jhum Cultivation in north eastern
parts of India, where farmers cut down trees
of the forest and burn the plant remains. The
ash is used as fertilizer and the land is used for
farming and cattle grazing. After cultivation,
the area is left for several years so as to allow
its recovery.
Major Effect of Deforestation is
the increased concentration of CO2 in the
atmosphere because trees hold lot of carbon in
their biomass, are lost with deforestation.
It leads to the loss of biodiversity due to
habitat destruction, disturbs hydrologic cycle,
causes soil erosion and desertification in
extreme cases.
Can you tell?
1. How Jhum cultication has led to
deforestation in recent years?
2. Comment on deforestation status of the
world and its major effects.

Reforestation is the process of restoring a
forest that once existed but was distroyed or
removed at some time in past. Reforestation
occurs naturally in a deforested area. We
can speed up this by plantation of tree with
due consideration to biodiversity that existed
before.
Best example of peoples participation
in reforestation is Saalumara Thimmakka,
an Indian environmentalist from state of
Karnataka noted for her work in planting

Can you recall?
What is Chipko movement?
Case study of people’s participation in
conservation of forests.
History of people’s participation in India
can be traced back to 1731. The ministers of
the king of Jodhpur in Rajasthan tried to cut
forest to procure wood for a new palace. Local
Bishnoi community known for peaceful coexistence with nature, opposed king’s men.
A Bishnoi woman Amrita Devi hugged
the trees and lost her life in an attempt for
protecting the forest. Her three daughters and
hundreds of other Bishnois too lost their lives.

The Government of India has recently instituted
Amrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife protection
Award for individuals or community from
rural areas that have shown extraordinary
courage and dedication in protecting wildlife.
In 1980s, realising the significance
of participation of local communities,
Government of India introduced the concept
of Joint Forest Management (JFM) so as
to work closely with local communities for
protecting and managing forests. In return, for
their services to the forest, the communities get
benefit of various forest products (Fruits, gum,
rubber, medicine etc.) and thus the forest can be
conserved in a sustainable manner.
15.11 Mission Harit Maharashtra :
An ambitious project of planting 50
crore trees in four years was taken up by
Government of Maharashtra in the year 2016.
Under this project yearly targets were given
to each district. The plantation drive is in line
with National Forest Policy (NFP) which aims
at maintaining 33% forest cover in the country.
A 24-hour toll free helpline number 1926
called ‘Hello Forest’ has been set up to provide
information regarding plantation, protection
and for mass awareness.

The Forest Department has created a
mobile application called ‘My Plants’ to record
details of the plantation such as numbers,
species and location. Authorities are expected
to take care of saplings in the first year i.e.,
year 2016, 2.87 crore saplings were planted.
In 2017, 5.17 crore and in 2018, 15.17crore
plantation count was achieved! In the year
2019, the government aimed at a phenomenal
33 crore sapling plantation which was launched
at Anandwan, Warora.
The government has decided to adapt
Japanese Miyawaki method of plantation
for this project. State Forest Department and
Social Forestry Department have run successful
pilot plantation programmes using Miyawaki
pattern in various districts like, Beed, Hingoli,
Pune, Jalgaon, Aurangabad etc.
