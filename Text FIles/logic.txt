NATIONAL ANTHEM

PREFACE

Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook Production & Curriculum Research is happy
to introduce Logic textbook for standard XIIth. Logic is a science of reasoning. Though
ability to reason is an inbuilt feature of human beings, the principles and methods of Logic,
make students aware of their innate abilities, which they can develop further through
practice.
The students at 10 + 2 level are curious and receptive, so the study of Logic will help
them to sharpen their intelligence, enhance the power of reasoning, develop the skill of
accurate thinking and enhance the creativity, which will help them to achieve their goals
and aspirations.
The syllabus deals with topics such as Decision Procedure, Deductive proof and
Quantificational Deduction, where the students will learn to first distinguish between valid
and invalid argument and then to prove the validity of arguments.
Various activity-based questions and exercises given in this textbook will help students
to understand the basic concepts of logic and master the methods of Logic. Q.R. code is
given on the first page of the textbook. You will like the information provided by it.
The bureau of textbook is thankful to the Logic Subject Committee and Study Group,
Scrutiny and Quality Reviewers and Artist for their dedication and co-operation in
preparing this textbook.
Hope Students, Teachers and Parents will welcome this textbook.

For Teachers

Logic subject committee and study group takes great pleasure in introducing
logic textbook. The chapter on categorical syllogism is introduced in the textbook.
After Standard XIIth, students have to take decision abour their career. They have
to appear for various entrance exams for the same. Most of the entrance exams have
a paper to test reasoning ability. The chapter on categorical syllogism will help
students to prepare for these various entrance exams. Teacher are expected to teach
this chapter keeping in mind its importance for the competitive exams. Comparison
between Aristotelian Categorical Syllogism and Nyaya syllogism will enlighten
students, how logic developed in India in similar way without being influenced
by the Greek thought. Which will enhance pride in Students mind about India’s
contribution to the subject.
Chapter on traditional logic is also introduced at this level, so that students can
compare traditional logic with modern logic and understand the development of
logic.
Introduction of predicate logic in the textbook will help students to understand
the difference between propositional logic and predicate logic, limitations of
propositional logic and need for predicate logic.
The chapter, Grounds of Inductions and hypothesis highlight the importance of
logic in scientific investigation.
Logic studies abstract concepts, so the important concepts in logic need to be
explained step by step, in easy to understand language and by giving examples
and various activities in such a way that, students can relate the subject to their
experiences in life. Keeping this in mind the textbook is made activity based.
Teachers are expected to make use of various examples, teaching aids and activities
like debates, logical puzzles and giving examples of good arguments and fallacies
from everyday experience. In this way teaching and learning can become interesting
and enjoyable experience for both students and teachers.

Decision Procedure

DO YOU KNOW THAT ..............
l
l

l

One can determine whether the statement form is tautology or not in a single row.
One can determine the validity of many complicated arguments by merely constructing a
shorter truth table.
As in geometry, so in logic, one can decide that a statement form is a tautology by showing
the impossibility of its opposite.
the method becomes complicated and difficult to
manage and the truth table becomes very long,
tedious and time consuming. We may make
errors while constructing it so lot of carefulness
is required. Hence we need shorter and accurate
method for determining whether a statement
form is tautology or not. Hence shorter truth
table method is introduced.

1.1 Decision procedure
I.M. Copi defines logic as “The study of
the methods and principles used to distinguish
good (correct) from bad (incorrect) reasoning.”
The two main functions in logic are - (i) To decide
whether an argument is valid or invalid; and (ii)
To decide whether a given statement form (truth
functional form) is a tautology, contradiction
or contingency. A procedure (or method) for
deciding these, is called a decision procedure.
The main requirement of a decision procedure
is that it must be effective. To be an effective
decision procedure, it must satisfy 3 conditions
– reliable, mechanical and finite.

The shorter Truth Table procedure can
be carried out in a single line. In fact this is
the main advantage of the shorter truth table
as a decision procedure. Shorter truth table
method is a quick and easy method. As it helps
us to decide whether an argument is valid and
whether a given statement form is tautology.

1.2 Need for shorter truth table method

1.3 Nature of shorter truth table method

We have already studied Truth Table
as an effective decision procedure. Though,
truth table is a simple and easy method for
deciding whether a statement form is tautology
or not and an argument is valid or invalid, but
it has certain limitations. Truth table becomes
inconvenient when a statement form involves
many variables i.e. with four variables the truth
table will have sixteen rows, five variables
thirty two rows and so on. With the increase in
number of propositional variables in a given
expression, the number of rows in the truth table
also increases. At such times the application of

Shorter truth table is a decision
procedure –
Shorter truth table method is an effective
decision procedure as is satisfies all the
conditions of an effective decision procedure.
i.e. reliable, mechanical and finite.
The shorter truth table method is based
on the principle of reductio-ad-absurdum.
The principle of Reductio-ad-absurdum means
to show that the opposite of what is to be
proved leads to an absurdity. In the case of

truth tables, one can assign truth values to
the various components of the statement
form.

argument we begin by assuming it to be invalid
and if the assumption leads to an inconsistency
then the argument is proved as valid otherwise it
is invalid.
In the case of statement form we first
assume it to be not a tautology and if the
assumption leads to an inconsistency then the
statement form is proved to be tautology or else
it is not a tautology.

(4)

Truth values are to be assigned to all
the connectives and the variables of the
statement form and every step is to be
numbered.

(5)

After assigning the truth value one has to
check whether there is any inconsistency.
Inconsistencies are of two types –
(i) Violation of rules of basic truth table
(ii) If a propositional variable gets both
truth values i.e. True as well as False.

(6)

An inconsistency will prove that the given
statement form is a tautology. If there is
no inconsistency, it will prove that the
statement form is not a tautology.

(7)

We mark the inconsistency with a cross
“x” below it.

(8)

Write whether the given statement form is
a tautology or not a tautology.

Since this method does not directly prove
whether the argument is valid/invalid or whether
the statement form is a tautology or not, it is
called the “Indirect method”.
1.4 Shorter Truth Table Method as a test
of Tautology –
The shorter truth table method is based
on the basic truth tables of truth functional
compound propositions.
Shorter truth table method is used to
decide whether a statement form is tautology
or not. Tautology is a truth functional statement
form which is true under all truth possibilities
of its components. While constructing shorter
truth table, we assume that the statement form
is not a tautology by placing the truth value
‘F’ under the main connective of the statement
form. If we arrive at an inconsistency, then
the assumption is wrong and given statement
form is a tautology (tautologous). If we do not
arrive at any inconsistency, then the assumption
is correct and hence the given statement form
is not a tautology. It is either contradictory or
contingency.

Following example demonstrates the procedure.
Example 1 ( p · p )  p
(1)

(p·p) p
F
		

This procedure involves the following
steps –
(1)

For determining whether a statement
form is a tautology, one has to begin by
assuming that it is not a tautology.

(2)

For assuming statement form is not a
tautology, one has to place ‘F’ under the
main connective of the statement form.

(3)

One has to assume that the given statement
form is ‘not a tautology’ by writing ‘F’
under the main connective ‘’. We mark
the assumption ‘F’ with a star as shown
below.

(2)

*

The next step is to assign values by using
basic truth tables. Since in the example,
implication is assumed to be false, the
antecedent has to be true and consequent
has to be false. So we assign values as
follows and number the steps.
(p·p)  p

After assigning ‘False’ truth value under
the main connective, with the help of basic

In the next step one has to assign truth
values to the component statements of
the antecedent. The antecedent is ‘p · p’
is true. Conjunction is true when both its
conjuncts are true. So one has to assign
values as follows and number them.

(3)

( p · p)  p
		T T T F F
		(2) (1) (2) * (1)
(4)

Next step is to find out whether these
assumption leads to any inconsistency. In
the above example one gets inconsistent
values for ‘p’. We indicate inconsistency
by ‘x’ mark as shown below.

		 F

( p • p)  p

( p ·  q)  ( q  p)

(4)

		 T T T F F
		(2) (1) (2) * (1)

In the above example there is inconsistency
in step number 1 and 2. So the assumption is
wrong. Hence the given statement form is a
tautology.

(5)

To begin with, one has to assume that the
given statement form is ‘not a tautology’,
by writing ‘F’ below the main connective
‘’ (Disjunction). We mark the assumption
“F” with a star as shown below.

			*
The next step is to assign truth values
by using basic truth tables. Since in the
example disjunction is assumed to be
false, both the disjuncts will be false.
( p ·  q)  ( q  p )

F F T F T F F

Next step is to see whether these truth
values lead to any inconsistency. In the
above example, there is no inconsistency.
The assumption is correct. Hence the given
statement form is not a tautology.

One has to assume that the given statement
form is ‘not a tautology’ by writing ‘F’ under
the main connective ‘’ (equivalence).
Equivalent statement is false under two
possibilities. – (1) The first component is
true and the second is false. And (2) The
first compoment is false and second is true.
We have to solve the example by assuming
both the possibilities.

Example 3 (p   q)   (q • p)

( p · q)  ( q  p )

Since one knows the truth values of both
‘p’ and ‘q’, the same truth values can be
assigned to the components of the left
disjunct, as shown below and number
them.

(3) (1) (5) (4) * (2) (1) (2)

Example 2 ( p ·  q)  ( q  p )
(1)

The next step is to assign truth values
to the components of both the disjuncts
and number them. In case of 1st disjunct
“·” (conjunction) is the main connective
and it is false. Conjunction is false under
three possibilities, so we should not assign
values to its components. We try to get
truth values of the second disjunct which is
“q  p”. Implication is false only under
one condition i.e. when its antecedent is
true and its consequent is false. So one
has to assign values to its components and
number them as shown below.

1st possibility
(1)

Considering the second possiblity, truth
values are assigned as follows.

Considering the first possibility, values are
assigned in the given example as follows.

The next step is to assign truth values to
the components of equivalence. In case of first
component ‘’ is false. So truth values are
assigned as follows.

The next step is to assign truth values
to the components of equivalence and

“” is the main connective and it is true.
Implication is true under three possibilities,
so we should not assign values to its
components. We try to get truth values
of the second compoment which is
‘  ( q • p )’. We already placed ‘F’ below
‘’. When negation is false, conjunction
has to be true. Accordingly one has to
assign values to its components as shown
below.

There is inconsistency in step number 1

of first possibility.

Example 4 ( p   q ) • (  p  q )
One has to begin by assuming the above
statement form to be ‘not a tautology’ by writing
‘F’ below ‘•’. Conjunction is false under three
possibilities. –

Now let’s consider the second possiblity
2 nd possibility

In above example we get inconsistency in
both the possiblities. So in both the possiblities it
is a tautology and therefore, the given statement
form is a tautology. It should be noted that if
one of the possibilities is not a tautology, then
the statement form is not a tautology. To be
tautology, the statement form must be tautology
under every possibility.

a tautology in the case of one possibility. Hence,
the given statement form is not a tautology.

If someone offers you a ticket to Europe tour or Asia tour then Logic is on your side, if you
accept the ticket for Europe but not Asia, You can prove the Conclusion by showing that its
denial is impossible.
When an idividual says ‘6 + 4’ is same as ‘4 + 6’ then that individual is using the rule of
Logic.
are other methods in Logic for establishing the
validity of arguments and one of the method is
the ‘Method of Deductive Proof’.
The Deductive Proof is of three types.
They are :
(1) The Direct Deductive Proof
(2) Conditional Proof
(3) Indirect Proof
In the Method of Direct Deductive Proof,
the conclusion is deduced directly from the
premises by a sequence of Elementary valid
argument forms. The Elementary valid argument
forms, used for this purpose are called the
‘Rules of Inference’; we have already dealt
with direct deductive proof and we know that
the Direct Deductive proof is based on nine
rules of inference and ten rules based on rule of
replacement as follows.

2.1 Formal Proof of Validity :
There are two types of methods used by the
logicians, for deciding or proving the validity of
arguments.
1)

Decision Procedure such as Truth Table
Method, Shorter truth table method, Truth
tree etc. are used to decide validity of
arguments.
2)
Methods that are not Decision procedure
such as Deductive proof, Conditional
proof, Indirect proof are used to prove
validity of arguments.
Truth-table is a purely mechanical method
for deciding whether an argument is valid or
invalid, however it is not a convenient method
when an argument contains many different
truth-functional statements. In such cases there

2.2 Conditional Proof

“By assuming the antecedent of the
conclusion as an additional premise, when its
consequent is deduced as the conclusion, the
original conclusion will be taken to have been
proved”.

The method of Conditional Proof is used
to establish the validity of arguments, when the
conclusion of an argument is an implicative
(conditional) proposition. The method of
Conditional Proof is based upon the Rule of
Conditional Proof.

Rule of Tautology (Taut.)
p º (p . p)
p º (p Ú p)

The Rule of Conditional Proof enables us
to construct shorter proofs of validity for some
arguments. Further by using it, we can prove
the validity of some arguments which cannot be
proved by using the above nineteen rules.

While using Conditional Proof, it should
be noted that the conclusion can be any statement
equivalent to a conditional statement. In such a
case, first the equivalent conditional statement is
derived and then the Rule of Conditional Proof
is used. However, in this chapter, we will use
Conditional Proof only when the conclusion is
a conditional statement.

The Rule of Conditional Proof may be
expressed in a simple way :

To illustrate let us construct a Conditional
Proof of Validity for the following argument :
10

Example : 1

The proof may now be written down as :

~MN

1.

~MN

\~NM

2.

~N

The proof may be written as follows :

3.

~ ~ M		

1, 2 . M.T.

1.

~MN

/\ ~NM

4.

5 . D.N.

~ N		

Assumption

5.

~ N  M		

3.

~ ~ M		

1, 2 . M.T.

4.

M		

3 . D.N.

If the conclusion has a compound
proposition with more than one conditional
statement as its components, then the antecedents
of all the conditional statements can be assumed
as additional premises.

From the premise 1 and the assumption,
one has deduced the consequent of the conclusion
by the Rule of M.T.

Let us take an example of this type :
Example : 2

However the proof is not complete. One
has yet to arrive at the conclusion. To do so one
more step remains to be taken, i.e. to write down
the conlcusion, ‘~ N  M’.
The proof is now written by adding step 5
1.

~MN

/\ ~NM

~ ~ M

4.

2 - 4, C.P.

The head of the arrow indicates that step
2 is an assumption. So the word “assumption”
need not be written as the justification.

Here the step 2 is the antecedent of the
conclusion. It is used as an assumption. (The
assumption should be indicated by bent arrow.)

thus :

/\ ~NM

2 - 4, C.P.

The conclusion step 5 has not been
deduced from the assumption. So the conclusion
lies outside the scope of the assumption. i.e. the
scope of the assumption ends up with the last
step which follows from step 4. To mark this out
clearly the device of a bent arrow (
) is used.
The head of the arrow points at the assumption
and its shaft runs down till it reaches the last
statement which is deduced on its basis, then the
arrow bends inwards and discharges (closes) the
assumption. The last step i.e. step 5, where the
conclusion is written, will lie outside the scope
of assumption.

Here the scope of the assumption in step
3 is independent of the scope of assumption in
step 7.
Hence assumption in step 7 lies outside
the scope of the assumption in step 3.
But in the next example-3 given below, the
scope of one assumption lies within the scope of
the other assumption.

consists in proving the conclusion by showing
that its negation leads to contradiction.
An Indirect Proof of validity for an argument
is constructed by assuming the negation of the
conclusion as an additional premise. From this
additional premise, along with original premise/s
a contradiction is derived. A contradiction is a
conjunction in which one conjunct is the denial
of the other conjunct. Eg. ‘A · ~ A’ , ‘(A Ú B) ·
~ (A Ú B)’, are contradictions.
By assuming the negation of the conclusion,
we obtain a contradiction. This shows that
the assumption is false. The assumption is the
negation of the conclusion. Since the assumption
is false, the original conclusion is taken to be
proved.

Here the assumption at step 5, lies within
the scope of the assumption of step 2.

When this method of proof is used, the
validity of the original argument is said to follow
by the rule of Indirect proof. Unlike conditional
proof the method of Indirect proof can be used
irrespective of the nature of the conclusion.

Give justifications for each step of the
following formal proofs of validity by the
method of conditional proof.

shows that the Rule of Indirect Proof is being
used. In the above example, we first assume
the negation of the conclusion then by using
rules of inference and rules based on the rule of
replacement, we arrive at a contradiction.

2.3 Indirect Proof :
The methods of Direct Deductive Proof
and Conditional Proof have one thing in common
while using them we deduce the conclusion
from the premises. The method of Indirect Proof
is completely different from these methods.

The last step of the proof is a contradiction,
which is a demonstration of the absurdity
derived by assuming ~ ~ M in the step 3. This
contradiction is formally expressed in the last
step exhibits the absurdity and completes the
proof.

The method of Indirect Proof is based on
the principle of reductio-ad-absurdum. Here
one assumes the opposite of what is to be proved
and this leads to an absurdity. i.e. this method

Summary
There are three types of Deductive Proofs :
(1) Direct Deductive Proof : In this method conclusion is derived directly from the premises.
(2) Conditional Proof : This method is used only when the conclusion of an argument is a
conditional statement. In this method the antecedent of the conclusion is taken as an
additional premise and the consequent of the conclusion is deduced with the help of the
required rules of Inference and rules based on the rule of replacement.
(3) Indirect Proof : This method is preferably used when the conclusion of an argument is
other than a conditional statement. In this method we assume the negation of the conclusion
as an additional premise.
From this, along with the original premises, we obtain a contradiction. And this is taken to
be the proof of validity of arguments.

Is this argument valid?
Test validity of this argument by using the method of truth table, shorter truth table, direct
deductive proof. C. P and, I. P.
What answer do you get?
In propositional logic by using
propositional constants one can symbolize the
above argument as follows –

3.1 Need for Predicate logic
The logic we have studied so far is known
as propositional logic. The methods that we have
studied in propositional logic like, Truth table,
Shorter truth table, Direct deductive proof, C.P.
and I.P. cannot decide or prove validity of all
arguments. These methods can be used only
for those arguments whose validity depends
upon the ways in which simple statements are
truth-functionally combined into compound
statements. The branch of logic which deals with
such type of arguments is called Propositional
logic.

S
M  C
It is obvious that the above given argument
is valid but it cannot be proved to be valid by
the methods of propositional logic. The method
of truth table on the contrary shows that the
argument is invalid. All the three statements
involved in the argument are non-compound
statements. The inner logical structure of
these statements and the relation between the
terms involved in the statements is important
in deciding the validity of this argument. The
relation between the class of singer and the class
of creative people is stated in the first premise.
It states that the class of singers is included in
the class of creative people i.e. whoever is a
singer is also creative. The second premise states
that the individual Mahesh belongs to the class
of singer and therefore in the conclusion it is
validly inferred that Mahesh also belongs to the
class of creative people. When the argument is
symbolized in propositional logic as stated above
the inner logical structure of the statements and
the relation between the terms involved is not
revealed. It is therefore necessary to symbolize
the argument in such a way that the inner logical

In Propositional logic a proposition is taken
as one unit. It does not involve analysis of the
proposition. It does not take into consideration
how terms in the propositions are related.
However there are certain types of arguments
whose validity depends upon the inner logical
structure of the non-compound statements it
contains. Methods of propositional logic are not
adequate in testing validity of such arguments.
Let us take an example All singers are creative.
Mahesh is a singer.
Therefore, Mahesh is creative.

Singular Propositions :

structure of the statements is revealed and then
one can prove validity of such arguments. The
branch of logic which deals with such types
of arguments is known as Predicate logic or
Predicate calculus.

Singular proposition makes an assertion
about a particular/specific individual. Singular
Proposition states that an individual possesses
or does not possess a certain property/
attribute (quality). Thus we get two types
of singular propositions, affirmative singular
propositions and negative singular propositions.
Affirmative singular proposition states that
an individual possesses a certain property,

Like propositional logic, in predicate
logic a proposition is not taken as one unit.
The propositions are analyzed and symbolized
to reveal, how the terms in the propositions are
related with each other. However, Predicate logic
is not totally different from propositional logic.
The methods and notations of propositional
logic are used in predicate logic so far as they
are applicable to the non-compound statements
with which it deals. If a formula is valid in
propositional logic, the corresponding formula
in predicate logic will also be valid. Though
predicate logic includes propositional logic
and is based on it, predicate logic goes beyond
propositional logic since it reveals the logical
structure of the propositions and the relation
between the different terms of the proposition.

For example : Sunita is a dancer.
Here ‘Sunita’ is a subject term and
‘dancer’ is a predicate term. Negative singular
proposition states that an individual does not
possess a certain property,
city.

For example : London is not an American

The word ‘individual’ here refers not only
to persons but to anything like a city, a country,
an animal or anything of which an attribute can
be significantly predicated and the ‘property’/
‘attribute’ may be an adjective, a noun or even a
verb. Following are some examples of singular
propositions -

Can you recognize and state how the
following non compound propositions differ
from each other? How can we classify them?

General Proposition :

Some things change.

General propositions make an assertion
about class/classes. General propositions are
broadly classified into two types – (1) General
propositions making an assertion about one class
and (2) General propositions making an assertion
about two classes or giving relation between
two classes. Each type is further classified into
Universal and Particular (Existential) general
proposition. Universal general proposition
makes an assertion about all members of a class
where as a particular general proposition makes

Ashish is smart.
All birds have wings.
Some children are brilliant.

Some mobile phones are not expensive.
Some things are not attractive.
3.2 Types of Propositions
The non compound propositions; whose
inner logical structure is significant in proving
validity of arguments in Predicate logic are
of two types – (1) Singular propositions and
(2) General propositions
18

an assertion about some members of a class.
Universal general proposition can be either
affirmative or negative. Similarly particular/

existential general proposition can also be either
affirmative or negative. Thus altogether we get
eight types of general propositions as given
below.

General propositions
		

One class

			

(1) Universal affirmative
(1)
e.g. Everything is interesting		
(2) Universal negative
(2)
e.g. Nothing is useless		
(3) Existential affirmative
(3)
e.g. Some things are beautiful		
(4) Existential negative
(4)
e.g. Some things are not clean		

Two classes

Universal affirmative ( A proposition)
e.g. All fruits are sweet
Universal negative ( E proposition)
e.g. No living being is immortal
Particular affirmative ( I proposition)
e.g. Some children are creative
Particular negative ( O proposition)
e.g. Some cities are not crowed

For example : the statement ‘Makarand is
not cunning’, is symbolized as ‘ Cm’.

3.3 Symbolization of singular and general
propositions

While symbolizing it is necessary to follow
the same two restrictions which we follow while
symbolizing propositions in propositional logic
namely:

Symbolizing singular propositions :
The two important components of
any singular propositions are – (1) Name of
an individual (2) Property / Attribute. Two
different symbols are used for symbolizing
these components namely Individual constant
and Predicate constant. An Individual constant
is a symbol which stand for the name of an
individual. Small letters of English alphabet
‘a’ to ‘w’ are used as individual constants.
Predicate constant is a symbol which stands
for the particular property/attribute. Capital
letters of English alphabet ‘A’ to ‘Z’ are used
as predicate constants. While symbolizing a
singular proposition, the symbol for the property
is written to the left of the symbol for the name
of an individual
For example : the singular proposition,
‘Suraj is wise’ is symbolized as ‘Ws’, here ‘W’
stands for the attribute ‘wise’ and ‘s’ stands for
the name of an individual i.e. Suraj. A negative
singular proposition is symbolized by placing
‘’ before the statement,

(1)

The same individual constant should
be used for symbolizing the name of an
individual if it occurs again in the same
argument or proposition. Similarly the
same predicate constant should be used
for symbolizing the name of property if
it occurs again in the same argument or
proposition.

(2)

In the same argument or proposition,
different individual constants and
predicate constants should be used for
different names of individual and property
respectively.

Before we learn symbolization of general
propositions it is necessary to learn about two
more important symbols used in predicate
logic i.e. Individual variable and Predicate
variable. Individual variable is a symbol
which stands for any individual whatsoever.
19

Symbolizing General propositions :

Individual variable does not stand for any
specific individual. It is only a place marker
which marks the place of an individual. It can be
replaced by a proper name of an individual or by
an individual constant. The small letters ‘x’, ‘y’,
‘z’ of English alphabet are used as individual
variables. For example, the proposition ‘Mohini
is beautiful’ is about the specific individual. But
in place of the name of a particular individual
i.e. Mohini if we leave a blank space keeping
the rest of the statement same, we shall get the
expression – ‘----------------- is beautiful’. The
blank space here is just a place marker that
marks the place of an individual, so in place of
blank space we can use individual variable ‘x’
and we will get the expression – ‘x is beautiful’
which can be symbolized as ‘Bx’. Similarly
Predicate variable is a symbol which stands
for any property/attribute whatsoever. It can
be replaced by any name of property or predicate
constant. The Greek letters  (phi) and  (psi)
are used as predicate variables. For example,
in the expression Surekha is -----, blank space
marks the place of some property, where we
can use predicate variable say ‘’ and we will
get an expression - ‘Surekha is ‘’, which can
be symbolized as ‘s’. In predicate logic such
expressions are called Propositional function.
We shall learn in detail about the concept of
propositional function later in the chapter.
Symbolize
the
propositions :

following

As stated earlier, general propositions are
broadly classified into two types – (1) General
propositions making an assertion about one class
and (2) General propositions making an assertion
about two classes or giving relation between two
classes. Let us first learn to symbolize general
propositions making an assertion about one
class.
(I)

Symbolizing General
about one class

propositions

General propositions can either be
universal or existential. These two types are
further classified into affirmative and negative
propositions. Thus we get four types of general
propositions about one class and they are
symbolized as stated below.
(1)

Universal affirmative proposition :

The proposition ‘Everything is perishable’,
for instance, is of this type. To symbolize this
proposition let us first convert it into logical
terminology. This proposition affirms the
property ‘perishable’ of everything. In the logical
terminology it can be expressed as follows Given anything, it is perishable
The expressions ‘anything’ and ‘it’ stand
for any individual whatsoever. So we shall use
individual variable in place of these words as
follows –

singular

Given any x, x is perishable.

(1) Nilesh is a singer.

In logic the expression ‘Given any x’ is
customarily symbolized by the symbol ‘(x)’.
This symbol is called ‘Universal quantifier’. By
using predicate constant ‘P’, ‘x is perishable’ can
be symbolized as ‘Px’. Accordingly the whole
statement will be symbolized as –

(2) John is an engineer.
(3) Ramesh is not a science student.
(4) Hemangi is smart and Hemangi is
creative.
(5) Zarin is beautiful.

(x) Px

(6) Amit is an actor but Amit is not a dancer.

The statement is to be read as, ‘Given
any x, x is perishable’. If we replace predicate
constant ‘P’ by predicate variable then we get
the form of such type of statements as given
below –

(7) Neena is Indian or Neena is American.
(8) New york is not an Australian city.

(x) x
20

(2)

Universal negative proposition :

This is to be read as –

The Proposition ‘Nothing is everlasting’
is of this type. The property ‘everlasting’ is
denied of all things. In logical terminology the
statement may be expressed as –

‘There is at least one x such that x is
beautiful.’ The form of such type of statement
is – (x) x
The second statement, ‘Dogs exist’ affirms
the existence of at least one dog. The statement
can be expressed in logical terminology as
follows –

Given anything, it is not everlasting.
By using individual variables instead of
the expressions ‘thing’ and ‘it’ we rewrite the
statement as –

dog.

Given any x, x is not everlasting.

By using individual variable the statement
can be rewritten as –

By using universal quantifier, predicate
constant ‘E’ and the symbol for negation, we
symbolize the whole statement as follows –

There is at least one x such that, x is a dog.

(x)  Ex

By using existential quantifier and
predicate constant ‘D’ we symbolize the whole
statement as given below –

The form of such type of propositions is –
(x)  x
(3)
type.

There is at least one thing such that, it is a

Existential affirmative proposition :

(x) Dx

The below given statements are of this

This it to be read as –

(1)

Something is beautiful.

(2)

Dogs exist.

‘There is at least one x such that, x is a
dog.’ The form of such type of statement is (x) x

The first proposition affirms the property
‘beautiful’ of some things. In logic the expression
‘some’ means at least one. Accordingly the
statement can be expressed in logical terminology
as follows –

(4)

Existential negative proposition :

There is at least one thing such that, it is
beautiful.

The first proposition denies the property
‘good’ of some things. It states that there is at
least one thing which is not good. The statement
can be expressed in logical terminology as
follows –

The following statements are of this type.

By using individual variable in place of
‘thing’ and ‘it’, the statement can be rewritten
as –
There is at least one x such that, x is
beautiful.

(1)

Something is not good.

(2)

There are no giants.

good.

The symbol ‘(x)’ is used for the
expression. ‘there is at least one x such that’.
The symbol is called ‘Existential quantifier’.
By using existential quantifier and predicate
constant ‘B’ for the property ‘beautiful’ we
symbolize the whole statement as given below –

There is at least one thing such that it is not

By using individual variable the statement
can be rewritten as –
good.

There is at least one x such that, x is not

By using existential quantifier and
predicate constant ‘G’ for the property ‘good’ we

(x) Bx
21

(1)

symbolize the whole statement as given below –
(x)  Gx

The proposition ‘All women are attractive’,
for example is of this kind. This proposition
states the relation between two classes namely –
the class of ‘women’ and the class of ‘attractive’.
It is a universal affirmative proposition because
in this proposition the property ‘attractive’
is affirmed of all women. This statement is
expressed in logical terminology as given
below -

This is to be read as –
‘There is at least one x such that x is not
good.’ The form of such type of statement is (x)  x
The second proposition ‘There are no
giants’ denies existence of giants. ‘Existence’ is
not a property/attribute. So the statement cannot
be translated in logical terminology as the first
statement. The proposition states that there is
not even one giant. The correct translation of
the statement in logical terminology is as given
below –

Given anything, if it is a woman then it is
attractive.
The terms ‘thing’ and ‘it’ stand for any
individual whatsoever. So we can replace them
by individual variable say ‘x’. Accordingly the
statement can be rewritten as –

It is not the case that, there is at least one
x such that, x is a giant. This correctly expresses
the statement’s meaning that there is not even
one giant.

Given any x, if x is a woman then x
is attractive. By using the symbol universal
quantifier for the expression ‘Given any x’,
predicate constant ‘W’ for ‘woman’, ‘A’ for
‘attractive’ and the connective ‘’ we symbolize
the whole proposition as follows –

By using the symbol for negation,
existential quantifier and predicate constant ‘G’
we can symbolize the whole statement as –

(x) ( WxAx )

(x) Gx

By replacing predicate constants by
predicate variables we can get the form of such
type of propositions as --- (x) ( x x)

This is to be read as –
‘It is not the case that, there is at least one
x such that, x is a giant’. The form of such type
of statement is - (x) x
(II) Symbolizing General
about two classes

Universal affirmative or ‘A’ proposition:

(2)

The proposition ‘No child is wicked’ is an
example of Universal negative or ‘E’ proposition.
This proposition states the relation between two
classes namely – the class of ‘children’ and the
class of ‘wicked’. It is a Universal negative
proposition because here the property ‘wicked’
is denied of all children. In logical terminology
this statement may be expressed as –

propositions

General propositions about two classes are
also of four types namely –
(1)

Universal affirmative or ‘A’ proposition.

(2)

Universal negative or ‘E’ proposition.

(3)

Particular affirmative or ‘I’ proposition.

(4)

Particular negative or ‘O’ proposition.

Universal negative or ‘E’ proposition :

Given anything, if it is a child then it is not
wicked.
By using individual variable instead of
‘thing’ and ‘it’, we express this statement as –

Let’s symbolize such types of proposition.

Given any x, if x is a child then x is not
wicked.
22

By using universal quantifier, predicate
constants and the connective ‘’, the whole
statement is symbolized as follows –

The form
(x) (x  x)
(4)

(x) ( Cx Wx )

‘I’

proposition

is

Particular negative or ‘O’ proposition :

The proposition ‘Some animal are not
wild’, for instance is an ‘O’ proposition. This
proposition states the relation between two
classes namely – the class of ‘animals’ and
the class of ‘wild’. It is a particular negative
proposition as the property ‘wild’ is denied
of some members of the class of ‘animals’.
This proposition can be translated in logical
terminology by using individual variable as
follows :

The form of ‘E’ proposition is –
(x) (x x )
(3)

of

Particular affirmative or ‘I’ proposition:

In particular affirmative or ‘I’ proposition
a property is affirmed of some members of a
class. The proposition ‘Some men are rich’,
for example, is a particular affirmative or ‘I’
proposition. This proposition states the relation
between two classes namely – the class of
‘men’ and the class of ‘rich’. It is a particular
affirmative proposition as the property ‘rich’
is affirmed of some members of the class of
‘men’. This proposition can be stated in logical
terminology as –

There is at least one x such that, x is an
animal and x is not wild
The whole statement is symbolized as
follows by using existential quantifier, predicate
constants and the symbols for connective ‘and’
and ‘not’

There is at least one thing such that, It is a
man and it is rich.

(x) ( Ax Wx )

The statement can be expressed by using
individual variables as follows –

The form of ‘O’ proposition is -(x) (x  x )

There is at least one x such that, x is a man
and x is rich.

General propositions do not always use
the expressions – ‘All’, ‘No’ and ‘Some’.
Apart from these words there are many other
words in English language which express these
propositions. Some common expressions in
English language which indicate these types of
propositions are given in the following table.

The whole statement is symbolized as
follows by using existential quantifier, predicate
constants and the symbol for connective ‘and’.
(x) (Mx  Rx)

‘A’ proposition : Affirmative sentences with words ‘all’, ‘every’, ‘each’, ‘any’, ‘always’,
‘whatever’, ‘invariable’, ‘necessarily’, ‘absolutely’
‘E’ proposition : Statements with words ‘no’, ‘never’, ‘not at all’, ‘not a single’, ‘not even
one’, ‘none’
‘I’ proposition : Affirmative statements with words ‘most’, ‘many’, ‘a few’, ‘certain’,
‘all most all’, ‘several’, ‘mostly’, ‘generally’, ‘frequently’, ‘often’, ‘perhaps’, ‘nearly always’,
‘sometimes’, ‘occasional’
Negative statements with ‘few’, ‘seldom’, ‘hardly’, ‘scarcely’, ‘rarely’
‘O’ proposition : When affirmative statements which contain words indicating ‘I’ proposition
are denied we get ‘O’ proposition.
Affirmative statements with the word ‘few’, ‘seldom’, ‘hardly’, ‘scarcely’, ‘rarely’
When ‘A’ proposition is denied we get ‘O’ proposition.

Give examples of all eight types of general propositions and symbolize them.
Propositional Function

is a bound variable, ‘x’ in the expression is free
variable as it is neither a part of a quantifier nor
preceded by an appropriate quantifier. Similarly
following expressions are also propositional
functions – ‘Bx’, Mx, x or ‘x’ here both the
variables ‘x’ and ‘’ are free/real.

Propositional function is an important
concept in predicate logic. ‘Deepa is an artist’
and ‘Suresh is a sportsman’, are propositions.
They are either true or false. However the
expressions, ‘x is an artist’ or ‘Ax’ and ‘Suresh
is ’ or ‘s’are not propositions as they are
neither true nor false. Such expressions are
called Propositional functions. A propositional
function is defined as an expression which
contains at least one (free/real) variable and
becomes a proposition when the variable is
replaced by a suitable constant.

Propositional function may be either simple
or complex. Simple propositional function is
one which does not contain propositional
connectives. For example –

Free variable is one which falls beyond
the scope of a quantifier. It is neither a part of
a quantifier nor preceded by an appropriate
quantifier.

(1)

x is big. (Bx)

(2)

y is smart (Sy)

(3)

Mukund is  m)

Propositional functions which contain
propositional connectives are called complex
propositional functions. For example –

Bound variable is one which is a part of
a quantifier or preceded by an appropriate
quantifier. For example, ‘Everything is
expensive’ is symbolized as – (x) (Ex). This is
a proposition and not a propositional function
as both the variables occurring in the expression
are not free but bound. In ‘(x)’ variable ‘x’ is a
part of the quantifier and in ‘Ex’; ‘x’ is preceded
by an appropriate quantifier. The expression,
‘(y) (Dx)’ however is a propositional function
because though the ‘y’ being part of the quantifier

substitution instance of it is either true or false.
The first singular proposition, ‘Aristotle is a
logician;, is true whereas the second proposition;
‘Newton is a logician’, is false.
A propositional function is either simple
or complex. In case of a complex propositional
function, the substitution instances obtained are
truth- functions of singular propositions. For
example ‘x is a dancer and x is an engineer’/
(Dx Ex )is a complex propositional function.
By replacing ‘x’ by proper name eg Ketan or
individual constant ‘k’ we get a substitution
instance which is a truth- function of a singular
propositions as follows –
‘Ketan is a dancer and Ketan is an engineer’
/ ( Dk  Ek )
(2) Quantification or Generalization
The process used to obtain general
propositions from a propositional function
is called Quantification or Generalization.
Quantification or Generalization is a
process of obtaining a general proposition
from a propositional function by placing an
Universal or Existential quantifier before
the propositional function. As there are two
types of general propositions, quantification
is of two types. (1) Universal Quantification/
generalization. (2) Existential Quantification/
generalization.
The Process of universal quantification
/ generalisation is used to obtain a universal
general proposition from a propositional
function
whereas
existential
general
propositions are obtained by the process of
Existential Quantification/ generalization from a
propositional function.

3.4 Methods of obtaining propositions
from propositional function –
In the last section we learned that a
propositional function is an expression which
contains at least one (free/real) variable and
becomes a proposition when the variable is
replaced by a suitable constant. Thus one can
obtain propositions from propositional functions
by replacing variables by suitable constants.
As there are two types of propositions namely
singular and general propositions, there are
two ways of obtaining propositions from
propositional functions. (1) Instantiation (2)
Quantification
(1)

Instantiation

The process of obtaining singular
propositions from a propositional function
by substituting a constant for a variable
is called Instantiation. For instance, ‘x is a
logician’/ ‘Lx’, is a propositional function.
From this propositional function by replacing
an individual variable ‘x’ with the proper name
of an individual eg ‘Aristotle’ or with a symbol
for the proper name(i.e. an individual constant)
say ‘a’, we can obtain a singular proposition as
follows- ‘Aristotle is a logician’/ ‘La’.
Individual variable ‘x’ can be replaced by
any name of an individual or by an individual
constant. By replacing ‘x’ by ‘Newton’ / ‘n’, we
shall get a singular proposition as—‘Newton
is a logician’/ ‘Ln’. Each singular proposition
obtained from a propositional function in
this manner is a substitution instance of
that propositional function. A propositional
function is neither true nor false; however every

propositions and prove their validity. The
method used to prove validity of such arguments
is called Quantificational Deduction.

The process of Universal Quantification
consists in obtaining an universal general
proposition by placing an universal quantifier
before the propositional function. For
example the expression ‘x is ‘gorgeous’ or ‘Gx’
is a propositional function. Here the property
‘gorgeous’ is asserted of an individual variable
‘x’. If we assert this property of all x then we
shall get an universal general proposition as
follows –

Like Deductive Proof, the Quantificational
Deduction consists in deducing the conclusion
of an argument with the help of certain rules.
The difference between the two is that in case
of the Quantificational Deduction, along with
19 rules of inference we require four more
rules of quantificational deduction. This is
because symbolization of arguments containing
non compound propositions involves use of
propositional functions and quantifiers; hence
their validity cannot be proved by 19 rules of
inference only.

‘Given any x, x is ‘gorgeous’

Universal general proposition thus
obtained may be either true or false. The
universal quantification of a propositional
function is true if and only if all its substitution
instances are true.

are :

Existential Quantification /
generalization :

The process of Existential Quantification
consists in obtaining an existential general
proposition by placing an existential
quantifier before the propositional function.
For example in propositional function – ‘x is
noble’ or ‘Nx’, the property ‘noble’ is asserted
of an individual variable ‘x’. by asserting this
property of some ‘x’ we can obtain existential
general proposition as given below –

The four rules of quantificational deduction

(1)

Universal Instantiation (UI)

(2)

Universal Generalization (UG)

(3)

Existential Generalization (EG)

(4)

Existential Instantiation (EI)

‘There is at least one x such that, x is noble’

These rules are necessary since quantifiers
are used while symbolizing general propositions.
The rules of UI and EI are used to infer truth
functional compound statements from general
propositions. Once they are changed into truth
functional compound statements, we can apply
19 rules of inference to derive the conclusion.
The rules of UG and EG are used for inferring
general propositions from truth functional
compound statements.

Rules of Quantification (Primary version)
(1)

Existential general propositions obtained
by the process of Existential Quantification may
be true or false. The existential quantification of
a propositional function is true even if one of its
substitution instance is true.

The rule of Universal Instantiation (UI)

The rule of Universal Instantiation
(UI) enables us to obtain truth functional
compound statement from universal general
proposition. This rule is based on the nature of
universal general proposition. As the universal
quantification of a propositional function is true
if and only if all its substitution instances are
true, the rule of UI states that, any substitution
instance of a propositional function can be

3.5 Quantificational Deduction
After having learned how to symbolize
non compound propositions i.e. singular and
general propositions, one can symbolize the
arguments which contain such non compound
26

Now we can apply the rule of U I to the
first premise –

validly inferred from its universal quantification.
In simple words it means, what is true of all
members of a class is true of each member of
that class. The symbolic representation of the
rule is -

(1)

(x) (Sx  Cx)

(2)

Sm

(x) (x)

(3)

Sm  Cm 1, U I

 

After inferring truth functional compound
statement from general statement, by rule of UI
rules of inference can be applied. By applying
the rule of M.P. to the statement 3 and 2 we can
infer the conclusion. Thus the validity of the
argument is proved.

(Where ‘’ is any individual symbol)
The rule of UI allows us to derive two
types of inferences. The Greek letter ‘’ (nu) in
rule, may stand for either a specific / particular
individual (individual constant) or an arbitrarily
selected individual. From the fact that what is
true of all members of a class is true of each
member of that class, it follows that this member
can either be a specific member or an arbitrarily
selected individual. For example, from the
universal general proposition, ‘everything is
beautiful’, one can infer a proposition about
specific individual eg, ‘Rita is beautiful’ or may
infer that any arbitrarily selected individual is
beautiful. The symbol ‘y’ is used for an arbitrarily
selected individual and a particular individual is
symbolizes by individual constant. Accordingly
symbolic representations of these two inferences
are as given below –

3,2 M.P.

Universal Generalization (UG)

The rule of Universal Generalization
(UG) allows us to derive a universal general
proposition from a truth functional compound
statement. One can validly infer that what is true
of all members of a class is true of each member
of that class but one cannot in the same fashion
say that what is true of a specific individual of
a class is true of all the members of that class.
For instance, we cannot say that Aurobindo is a
philosopher therefore all men are philosophers.
However one can say that, what is true of a
man in general (i.e. without considering any
specific qualities) is true of all men. To take
an example, one can validly infer that a man is

Mahesh is a singer.

All singers are creative.

While applying the rule of UI one has
an option of taking any individual constant or
arbitrarily selected individual – ‘y’. From the
nature of premises and the conclusion one can
decide whether to take an individual constant
or ‘y’. in the above example the conclusion and
the second premise is about specific individual
Mahesh (m) so we used the same individual
constant, which enabled us to apply rule of M.P.
to derive the conclusion, which would not have
been possible if we had used ‘y’ or any other
constant other than ‘m’.

Let us now take the argument, we had taken
in the beginning of the chapter and construct
formal proof of validity for it by using the rule

rational therefore all men are rational. From this
it follows that, from statement which is about
an arbitrarily selected individual one can infer a
universal general statement. So the rule of UG is
stated as follows –

The rule of EG is used to get an existential
general proposition from a truth functional
compound statement. Existential general
proposition makes an assertion about some
members of a class. The term ‘some’, means ‘at
least one’ in logic. So unlike the rule of UG, in
case of the rule of EG one can validly infer that,
what is true of a specific individual of a class
is true of some individuals of that class. One
can also infer existential general proposition
from a statement about an arbitrarily selected
individual. The rule of EG is stated as follows –

Universal
quantification

a
propositional function can be validly inferred
from its substitution instance which is an
arbitrarily selected individual. The symbolic
representation of the rule is –

The existential quantification of a
propositional function can be validly inferred
from any of its substitution instance. The
symbolic form of the rule is –

individual.)
Let us now construct formal proof of
validity for the following argument by using
both the rules of UI and UG.

All men are honest.

All honest people are good.

(Where ‘’ is any individual symbol)

Therefore, all men are good.

To take an example we can infer a
proposition, ‘some men are handsome’ from
a statement about specific individual eg, ‘Anil
is handsome’ or about an arbitrarily selected
individual. These may be symbolically expressed
as follows –

Let us first symbolize the argument as
follows –
(1)

(x) (Mx  Hx)

(2)

(x) (Hx  Gx) / (x) (Mx  Gx)

Next step is to apply the rule of UI to step
no.1 and 2 then derive the conclusion by the rule
of H.S and apply the rule of UG to step 5 to get
the conclusion as shown below. While applying
UI it is necessary to take ‘y’ in the place of ‘x’
because the conclusion is a universal general
proposition and to get conclusion we will have
to use the rule of UG at the end, which is possible
only if we take ‘y’

The important point one needs to
remember here is that, when in an argument,
one has to use both rule of UI and EI, the
rule of EI should be used first. This is because
for use of EI there is a restriction that, only
that individual constant should be used which
has not occurred earlier in the context. In the
above argument if UI was used first, then while
applying EI we could not have taken the same
individual constant and with different constants
we could not have arrived at the conclusion.

The rule of Existential Instantiation
states that from the existential quantification
of a proposition function we may infer the
truth of its substitution instance. The rule
enables us to infer a truth functional compound
statement from an existential general proposition.
Existential
quantification
of
a
propositional function is true only if it has at
least one true substitution instance. As what
is true of some members of a class cannot be
true of any arbitrarily selected individual of
that class, the substitution instance cannot be
an arbitrarily selected individual. From the
statement ‘some men are caring’, one cannot
infer that any arbitrarily selected man is caring.
The truth functional statement that we drive can
be about a particular individual only, but we
may not know anything else about that person.
So while applying the rule of EI one must take
that individual constant which has not occurred
earlier in the context. The symbolic form of this
rule is as given below –

Let us take some more examples –

(Where ‘’ is an individual constant, other
than ‘y’, that has not occurred earlier in the
context.)

In Propositional logic a proposition is taken as one unit. It does not involve analysis of
proposition.
Predicate logic involves analysis of proposition. It deals with certain types of arguments
whose validity depends upon the inner logical structure of the non-compound statements it
contains.
The non compound statements in Predicate logic are of two types – Singular propositions
and General propositions.
Singular propositions states that an individual possesses or does not possess a certain
property/ attribute (quality).
Singular propositions are of two types – affirmative singular propositions and negative
singular propositions
General propositions make an assertion about class.
General propositions are classified into two types – (1) General propositions about one
class and (2) General propositions about two classes.
Each type is further classified in to Universal affirmative, Universal Negative, Particular
(Existential) affirmative, Particular (Existential) Negative.

A propositional function is defined as an expression which contains at least one (free/real)
variable and becomes a proposition when the variable is replaced by a suitable constant.
The process of obtaining a singular proposition from a propositional function by substituting
a constant for a variable is called Instantiation.
Quantification and Generalization is a process of obtaining a general proposition from a
propositional function by placing a universal or Existential quantifier before the propositional
function.
Quantification is of two types. (1) Universal Quantification/ generalization. (2) Existential
Quantification/generalization
The Quantificational Deduction consists in deducing the conclusion of an argument from
its premises with the help of certain rules.
Rules of quantificational deduction are – (1) Universal Instantiation (U I), (2) Universal
Generalization (U G), (3) Existential Generalization (E G), (4) Existential Instantiation (E
I)
The rules of UI and EI are used to infer truth functional compound statements from general
propositions.
The rules of UG and EG are used for inferring general propositions from truth functional
compound statements.

Traditional Logic
The first proposition, asserts that ‘All
cows are animals’. while the second proposition
denies that ‘Some students are successful.’

4.1 Nature of Propositions in Traditional
Logic :
The Greek Philosopher Aristotle is the
founder of Traditional Logic. According
to
Aristotle proposition consists of terms. A Term
is defined as a word, or group of words which
stands as the subject or predicate of a logical
proposition.

Terms are constituents of a proposition.
The two terms i.e. the subject and predicate of
the proposition are unified by the means of a
copula. Thus a proposition has three constituent
elements, namely : subject, predicate and copula.
The order of the three elements in a proposition
is Subject-Copula-Predicate.

For example :
(1)

Intelligent people are creative.

(2)

Bhumika is the tallest girl in the class.

(3)

Tejas is clever.

Eg. ‘All apples are red’.
In the above example ‘Apples’ is the
subject, ‘red’ is the predicate and the word
‘are’ which unifies both ‘apple’ and ‘red’ is the
copula.

In the first proposition, the subject term
‘Intelligent people’, is a group of words. In the
second proposition the predicate term ‘tallest
girl’, is a group of words and in the third example
both the subject term ‘Tejas’ and predicate term
‘clever’ , are single words.

4.2 Traditional Classification of
Propositions
In Traditional Logic Propositions are
classified into two categories :

Term is a part of speech representing
something, but it is neither true nor false.
e.g. man, animal, mortality etc. However the
proposition which consists of terms, is either
true or false. An inference can be drawn on
the basis of the existing relation between these
terms. According to Aristotle, all propositions
either assert or deny something. That about
which assertion / denial is made, is called the
‘Subject term’ and that which is asserted / denied
of subject is called the ‘Predicate term’. Terms
may refer to a whole class, or some members of
a class.

(1)

Conditional Proposition

(2)

Categorical Proposition

4.2.1 Conditional Proposition :
A Conditional proposition is one in
which the assertion is made subject to some
expressed condition. For example : ‘If diesel oil
is brought near fire, it will explode’.
In this example ‘occurrence of explosion’
is subject to the condition of ‘diesel oil being
brought near fire’.

For example :

Conditional Propositions are of two kinds :

(1)

All cows are animals.

(i)

Hypothetical Proposition

(2)

Some students are not Successful.

(ii)

Disjunctive Proposition

In the first proposition, ‘cows’ is the subject
term and ‘animals’ is the predicate term. In the
second proposition, ‘students’ is the subject term
and ‘successful’ is the predicate term.

(i)

Hypothetical Proposition :
A hypothetical proposition is one
which presents a condition together with
some consequence which follows from it.
36

In a hypothetical proposition there are two
propositions. The proposition which states the
condition and the proposition which expresses
the consequence. The proposition which states
the condition is called the antecedent and that
which expresses the consequence is called the
consequent.

Every Categorical proposition has both
quality and quantity. Quality of Categorical
proposition means that the propositions either
assert something or deny something. It is either
an Affirmative or Negative proposition. A
Categorical proposition is affirmative when its
predicate term is affirmed of the subject term and
it is negative when its predicate term is denied of
the subject term.

For example : ‘If metal is heated, it
expands. In this example, it does not refer to any
actual instance of metal being expanded when
heated, but it only states the condition that if
the condition is fulfilled, the consequences will
follow.

For example :

(ii) Disjunctive Proposition : A Disjunctive
proposition is one which states alternatives.
This proposition asserts that the alternatives are
mutually exclusive or inclusive.

A line is straight or curved.

(2)

Either Ganesh will sing or dance.

Some people are honest.

(2)

No Elephants are carnivorous animals.

The first proposition is affirmative, as in
this proposition, the predicate term ‘honest’
is affirmed of the subject term ‘people’ and
the second proposition is negative, as in this
proposition, the predicate term ‘carnivorous
animals’ is denied of the subject term ‘Elephants’.

For example :
(1)

(1)

Every Categorical proposition has
quantity. A Categorical proposition may assert
or deny something about the predicate term.
The assertion or denial may refer to either entire
(whole) class or some members (part) of the
class of subject term. A Categorical Proposition
is either Universal or Particular.

In the first example the alternatives are
mutually exclusive. If we affirm that ‘the line
is straight’, then we must deny ‘it is curved’
and vice versa. But in the second example the
alternatives are not mutually exclusive but
inclusive. By affirming the alternative that
‘Ganesh will sing’, we cannot deny that ‘Ganesh
will dance’.

It is universal when it refers to all members
of the class of the Subject term and it is Particular
when it refers to some members of the class of
the Subject term.

4.2.2 Categorical Propositions :

For example :

Categorical proposition is a proposition
of relationship between two classes referred
to as the class of subject term and the class of
predicate term.

(1)

All chess players are logical.

(2)

Some languages are difficult.

The first proposition is Universal, as in
this proposition the subject term i.e. ‘the class of
chess players’ refers to the entire class to which it
applies and the second proposition is Particular,
as in this proposition the subject term i.e. ‘the
class of langueages’ refers to some members of
the class to which it applies.

By a ‘class’ Aristotle means a collection
of all individuals, objects etc that have some
specified characteristic in common. A categorical
proposition affirms or denies a predicate of a
subject absolutely. i.e. without any condition. It
is unconditional Proposition. For example : ‘All
Chillies are pungent’. The pungency of chilly is
not determined by any condition.

37

Classification of Categorical Propositions

‘No S is P’. Where ‘S’ and ‘P’ represent the
subject and predicate terms, respectively. This
proposition is also called as ‘E’ proposition. It
denies the relation of inclusion between two
classes universally. No members of class ‘S’ are
members of class ‘P’. This proposition asserts
that class of subject term, S is wholly excluded
from class of predicate term ‘P’.

According to quality, propositions are
classified into Affirmative and Negative and
according to quantity, they are classified as
Universal and Particular. Thus on the basis of
these two principles of quality and quantity, there
are four kinds of propositions. This is called the
‘Traditional scheme’ of Propositions. It is also
called as Four fold classification of propositions.
The four kinds of propositions included in
Traditional scheme are as follows :
(1)

(3)

When the proposition is particular in
quantity and affirmative in quality, it is called
Particular Affirmative Proposition. This
proposition asserts that Some members of one
class i.e. the class of Subject term are included
in another class i.e. the class of predicate term.
Eg. ‘Some books are amusing’. This proposition
asserts that some members of  the class of subject
term ‘books’ are included in another class
of predicate term ‘amusing’.   Any Particular
Affirmative proposition may be schematically
written as ‘Some S is P’, which says that atleast
one member of class of subject term ‘S’ is also
the member of the class of predicate term ‘P’.
This proposition is also called as ‘I’ Proposition.
It affirms the relation of inclusion between
two classes partially. It asserts that the class of
subject term, ‘S’ is partially included in class of
predicate term ‘P’.

Universal Affirmative (‘A’ Proposition) :

When the proposition is universal in
quantity and affirmative in quality, it is called
Universal Affirmative proposition. This
proposition asserts that the whole of one class
i.e. the class of subject term is included in
another class i.e. the class of Predicate term. Eg.
‘All Teachers are qualified’. This proposition
asserts that every member of the class of subject
term, ‘Teachers’, is a member of another class
of predicate term, ‘qalified persons’. Any
Universal Affirmative proposition can be written
schematically as follows : ‘All S is P’. Where
the letters ‘S’ and ‘P’ represent the subject and
predicate terms, respectively. This proposition is
also called as ‘A’ proposition. It affirms that the
relation of inclusion holds between two classes
and says that the inclusion is complete. (i.e.
universal) All members of class ‘S’ are said to
be, also the members of class ‘P’. In other words
class S is wholly included in class ‘P’.
(2)

Particular Affirmative (‘I’ Proposition) :

(4)

Particular Negative (‘O’ Proposition) :

When the Proposition is particular in
quantity and negative in quality, it is called
Particular Negative Proposition. This proposition
asserts that some members of one class i.e. class
of subject term are excluded from another class
i.e. the class of predicate term. Eg. Some animals
are not wild. This proposition asserts that some
members of the class of subject term, ‘animals’
are excluded from another class of predicate
term ‘Wild beings’. Any Particular Negative
proposition may be schematically written as
‘Some S is not P’, which says that atleast one
member of the class of subject term ‘S’ is not the
member of the class of predicate term ‘P’. This
proposition is also called as ‘O’ Proposition.
It denies the relation of inclusion between two

Universal Negative (‘E’ Proposition) :

When the proposition is universal in
quantity and negative in quality, it is called
Universal Negative proposition. This proposition
asserts that the whole of one class i.e. the class
of subject term is excluded from another class
i.e. the class of Predicate term. Eg. No lions
are Tigers. This proposition asserts that every
member of the class of subject term, ‘Lions’, is
not a member of another class of predicate term,
‘Tigers’. Any Universal Negative proposition
can be written schematically as follows :

38

For example :

classes partially. It asserts that the class of
subject term, ‘S’ is partially excluded from the
class of predicate term ‘P’.
Singular Proposition :

(1)

Smruti is smart.

(2)

Yogesh is not a coward.

The first example is a Singular Affirmative
proposition. It is considered as ‘A’ proposition
in Traditional logic and the second example is a
Singular Negative proposition. It is considered
as ‘E’ proposition in traditional logic.

There is another sub-class of propositions,
on the basis of quantity. This is singular
proposition. A Singular proposition is one in
which the predicate is affirmed or denied of a
single definite individual. It means the subject
of a Singular proposition is a singular term.
Traditional logicians considered singular
proposition to be Universal Proposition. This is
because in a singular proposition, the affirmation
or the denial is of the whole subject. A Singular
Affirmative proposition is treated as Universal
Affirmative proposition i.e. ‘A’ Proposition and
a Negative Singular proposition is considered
as Universal Negative Proposition i.e. ‘E’
Proposition.

Propositions in ordinary language :
One already knows that a typical
Categorical proposition uses the words ‘all’ or
‘some’ to denote the quantity of the subject.
However in everyday life, one does not always
use these words. Ordinary language has variety
of words, that denote these quantities.
For example :
(1)

Parents are always caring.

(2)

A few voters are patriotic.

Different words indicating ‘A’, ‘E’, ‘I’, ‘O’ propositions are given in the table below :
Categorical
Propositions

Words used in a proposition

A

All, every, any, each, always, absolutely, necessarily, invariably,
whichever, whoever, whatever etc.

E

No, Not a single, Not even one, never, Not at all, none etc. (These
words have Negative meaning)

I

Some, A few, many, most, several, generally, frequently, occasionally,
Perhaps, often, certain, all most all, nearly always, etc.

O

Hardly, rarely, scarcely, seldom, few, etc. (These words have negative
meaning)

When ‘A’ proposition is negated, we get ‘O’ proposition.
When ‘I’ proposition is negated, we get ‘O’ proposition.
When ‘O’ proposition is negated, we get ‘I’ proposition.

4.3 Distribution of terms in Categorical
Propositions

‘E’ Proposition is an Universal Negative
Proposition. Its symbolic form is ‘No S is P’. e.g.
No Squares are triangles. In this example the class
of subject term squares is wholly excluded from
another class of predicate term, ‘triangles’. So
the subject term of ‘E’ Proposition is distributed.
The class of predicate term ‘Triangles’ also
refers to the entire class. The class of predicate
term ‘triangles’ is also wholly excluded from the
class of subject term ‘squares’. So the predicate
term of ‘E’ Proposition is also distributed.

A Categorical proposition may refer to all
members of the class or some members of the
class. Distribution of term is determined by its
reference to class. The term of proposition is
distributed when the proposition refers to the
entire class to which it applies and the term of
a proposition is undistributed when it refers
to the part of the class to which it applies. Thus
each term of a proposition is either distributed or
undistributed.
Distribution of terms in Categorical
Propositions are as follows :
(1)

Distribution of terms in Universal
Negative / ‘E’ Proposition :

Distribution of terms in Universal Negative
‘E’ Proposition is well explained by Logician
Euler in the following diagram.

Distribution of terms in Universal
Affirmative / ‘A’ Proposition :

‘A’ Proposition is an Universal Affirmative
Proposition. Its symbolic form is  ‘All S is P’.
e.g. All parrots are birds. The above example
indicates that the class of subject term ‘parrots’,
is wholly included in another class of predicate
term, ‘birds’. So the subject term of ‘A’
Proposition is distributed. whereas the class of
predicate term ‘birds’ is not wholly included in
the class of subject term ‘parrots’. Only part of the
class of predicate term, ‘birds’ is included in the
class of subject term, ‘parrots’. So the predicate
term of ‘A’ Proposition is undistributed.

S

T

‘S’ indicates the class of squares and ‘T’
indicates the class of Triangles.
Hence both the subject term and the
predicate term are distributed in ‘E’ Proposition.
(3)

Distribution of terms in Universal
Affirmative/ ‘A’ Proposition is well explained
by Logician Euler in the following diagram.

Distribution of terms in Particular
Affirmative / ‘I’ Proposition :

‘I’ is a Particular Affirmative Proposition.
Its symbolic form is ‘Some S is P’. e.g. Some
Oranges are sour fruits. In this example the
class of subject term, ‘Oranges’ is partially
included in another class of predicate term, ‘sour
fruits’. So the subject term of ‘I’ proposition is
undistributed. The class of predicate term ‘sour
fruits’ is also partially included in the class of
subject term ‘Oranges’. So the predicate term of
‘I’ proposition is also undistributed.

B
P

‘P’ indicates the class of parrots and ‘B’
indicates the Class of birds.
Hence the subject term is distributed
but the predicate term is undistributed in ‘A’
proposition.
40

Distribution of terms in Particular
Affirmative ‘I’ Proposition is well explained by
Logician Euler in the following diagram.

Hence the subject term is undistributed in
‘O’ Proposition, whereas the predicate term is
distributed in ‘O’ Proposition.
Complete the following table.

S

‘O’ is the class of oranges and ‘S’ is the
Class of sour fruits. ‘x’ indicates that it is the
member of both the classes.

Undistributed

4.4 Types of Inference

Hence both the subject term and the
predicate term are undistributed in ‘I’ Proposition.

Inference is the process of deriving the
conclusion on the basis of observed facts.

(4)

For example : After observing the flooded
streets, one can derive a conclusion that it might
have rained heavily.

Distribution of terms in Particular
Negative / ‘O’ Proposition :

‘O’ is a Particular Negative Proposition.
Its symbolic form is ‘Some S is not P’. e.g. Some
cats are not white animals. In this example the
class of subject term, ‘cats’ is partially excluded
from another class of predicate term, ‘white
animals’. So the subject term of ‘O’ proposition
is undistributed, but the class of predicate term
‘white animals’ is wholly excluded from the
class of subject term ‘cats’.   So the predicate
term of ‘O’ proposition is distributed.

Inference is of two types, namely
Inductive and Deductive Inference. Traditional
Logic explains the difference between Inductive
inference and Deductive Inference as follows :
In Inductive inference, one proceeds from
particular to general proposition.
e.g. The general proposition that ‘All
cherries are red’, is derived on the basis of
observation of few cherries which are red.

Distribution of terms in Particular Negative
‘O’ Proposition is well explained by Logician
Euler in the following diagram.

In Deductive inference, one proceeds from
general to particular proposition.
For example :

W

C

All Indians are intelligent.
Rajvi is an Indian

x

Therefore Rajvi is intelligent.
Deductive inference is of two types :
(1) Immediate (2) Mediate
4.4.1 Immediate Inference :
Immediate inference is a kind of Deductive
inference in which the conclusion is drawn
directly from one premise without the mediation
of any other premise.

‘C’ indicates the class of cats and ‘W’ is
the class of whit animals. ‘x’ indicates that it
is the member of the class of cats but is not the
member of the class of white animals.

41

(2)

Traditionally there are two types of
Immediate Inferences :
(1)

Inference by Opposition of Propositions
and

(2)

Inference by Eduction.

(1)

Inference by Opposition of Propositions:

Traditinally, a   pair  of  UniversalPropositions  
having the same subject and predicate terms but
which differ in quality are contraries. Thus ‘A’
Proposition and ‘E’ Proposition are contraries.
For example : ‘All artists are creative
persons’, is ‘A’ Proposition and ‘No artists are
creative persons’, is ‘E’ Proposition.

Opposition of Propositions is the
relation between any two kinds of Categorical
propositions having the same subject and
predicate terms, but differing in either
quantity, quality or both quantity and quality.
Considering A, E, I, O in pairs we get four kinds
of oppositions, which are correlated with some
important truth relations, as follows :
(1)

The contraries cannot be true together, but
may be false together.  
Contrary relation can be shown in the table
as follows :

Contradicatory relation 			
[Contradictories] :

Two standard forms of categorical
propositions that have the same subject and
predicate terms, but differ from each other in
both quantity and quality are contradictories.
Thus ‘A’ Proposition and ‘O’ Propositions are
contradictories.

For example : ‘Some rich men are

men are not handsome’, is ‘O’  Proposition.

For example : ‘No pilots are Marine
Engineers’, is ‘E’ Proposition and ‘Some pilots
and Marine Engineers’, is ‘I’ Proposition.

A

A

Traditionally, a pair of Particular
Propositions having the same subject and
predicate terms but which differ in quality are
Sub-contraries. Thus ‘I’ Proposition and ‘O’
Proposition are Sub-contraries.

For example : ‘All lawyers are fighters’
is an ‘A’ Proposition and ‘Some lawyers are not
fighters is ‘O’ Proposition.
Similarly ‘E’ Proposition
Propositions are contradictories.

Sub-Altern relation :

When two Categorical propositions with
the same subject and predicate terms, agree
in quality but differ in quantity, are called
corresponding propositions. Thus ‘A’ Proposition
and ‘I’ Propositions are corresponding.
For example : ‘All branded things are
expensive’, is ‘A’ Proposition and ‘Some
42

Traditional Logician Aristotle has shown
the relation between four kinds of Categorical
Propositions in a square as shown below :
sub-alternant

A
E

Similarly ‘E’ Proposition and ‘O’
Propositions are corresponding propositions.

Sub-altern

For example : ‘No Monkeys are donkeys’,
is ‘E’ Proposition and ‘Some Monkeys are not
donkey’ is ‘O’ Proposition.
This opposition between an Universal
proposition and its corresponding Particular
proposition is known as Sub-altern. In any
such pair of corresponding propositions, the
Universal proposition is called subalternant
and the Particular proposition is called
sub-alternate. In sub-altern relation the
subalternants (Universal propositions) imply
their corresponding sub-alternates (Particular
propositions). If universal proposition in any
one pair is true then its corresponding Particular
proposition is also true and if universal
proposition in any one pair is false then its
corresponding Particular proposition is doubtful.

If Particular proposition in any one pair is
true then its corresponding Universal proposition
is doubtful and if the Particular proposition
in any one pair is false then its corresponding
Universal proposition is also false.

Eductions :

Therefore the converse of ‘A’ Proposition is ‘I’
Proposition,

Eductions are those forms of immediate
inferences in which, one deduces the conclusion,
by interchanging the positions of the subject
term and the Predicate term of the Premise. i.e. if
the Premise is true, Conclusion is also true and if
the Premise is false, the conclusion is also false.

For example : ‘All roses are red’.
This is ‘A’ Proposition. Converse of ‘A’
Proposition is ‘I’ Proposition i.e. ‘Some red
flowers are roses’.  
(2) Converse of ‘A’ Proposition remains ‘A’
Proposition, when the denotation of both the
terms, i.e. the subject term and the predicate
term is the same.

There are seven kinds of Eductions. two of
which are fundamental. The basic Eductions are
: (1) Conversion and (2) Obversion
1.

Conversion :

For example : ‘The shortest Atricle in this
magazine, is the best’.

Conversion is a process of immediate
inference in which, predicate term of the premise
becomes the subject term of the conclusion
and the subject term of the premise becomes
the Predicate term of the conclusion. Thus in
conversion the subject term and the predicate
term are interchanged. The original proposition/
premise is called the ‘Convertend’ and Inferred
proposition/conclusion is called Converse.

This is Singular affirmative Proposition,
but it is considered as Universal affirmative
proposition (‘A’ Proposition) in Traditional
Logic. In this proposition the subject term
is ‘shortest’ and the predicate term is ‘best’,
denotation of both these terms is the same. When
one infers converse from this proposition, one
merely interchanges the position of the subject
term and the predicate term. The converse of this
proposition is ‘The best Article in this Magazine
is shortest’. i.e. the converse of ‘A’ remains ‘A’.

There are certain rules of Conversion as
follows :
(i)

The Rule of Quality :

The quality of the converse (conclusion)
must remain the same as the original proposition
(premise). If the premise is affirmative, the
conclusion must be affirmative and if the premise
is negative, the conclusion must be negative.’
(ii)

(3) Similarly the converse of ‘A’ Proposition
will remain ‘A’ Proposition, when the predicate
term is the definition of the subject term or
peculiar quality possessed by the subject term.
For example : ‘Man is a rational animal.’

The Rule of Distribution :

The converse of this proposition is
‘Rational animal is man’. In this case also the
converse of ‘A’ remains ‘A’, As it is the definition
of ‘Man’ that he is a ‘rational animal’, When
converse of any proposition remains the same
proposition it is called as ‘Simple Converse’.

No term is distributed in the converse
(Conclusion) unless it is distributed in the
original proposition (Premise). If a term is
undistributed in the premise, then it must remain
undistributed in the conclusion.
Conversion can be explained with the help
of examples as follows :

(4) Converse of ‘E’ Proposition is ‘E’
Proposition. It is called as Simple Converse.

(1) Converse of ‘A’ Proposition as per the rule
of quality can be either ‘A’ or ‘I’. However the
converse of ‘A’ proposition cannot be ‘A’.

For example : ‘No Ladyfingers are leafy
vegetables’.  The converse of this proposition is
‘No leafy vegetables are Ladyfingers.

For example : ‘All roses are red’.
It’s converse cannot be ‘All red flowers are
roses’ because the rule of distribution is violated.
45

(5) Converse of ‘I’ Proposition is ‘I’
Proposition. It is also called as Simple Converse.

8.    Hardly children are extroverts.
       Converse :
_________________________________

For example : ‘Some actors are dancers.
Converse of this proposition is some dancers are
actors.’

9.    Indians are generally vegetarians.
       Converse :
_________________________________

(6) Converse of ‘O’ Proposition is not possible.
Because according to the rule of Quality, the
quality of converse must remain the same. ‘O’
is a negative proposition so its converse must
be negative. i.e. either ‘O’ or ‘E’ Proposition.
In both these cases, the subject term which is
undistributed in the premise of ‘O’ proposition,
gets distributed in the conclusion as it becomes
the predicate of ‘O’ / ‘E’ proposition in the
conclusion.

10.  A few teachers are strict.
       Converse :
________________________________
Complete the following table:
Convertend
A - All S is P

Converse
I - Some P is S

E - No S is P
1.    Hexagon means six sided polygon.

I - Some S is P

       Converse :
_________________________________

O - Some S is not P
(2)

2.    Any Chickoo is ripe

Obversion :

Obversion is a process of inference in
which the subject term in the conclusion remains
the same, as the subject term in the premise, but
the predicate of the conclusion is complement
(contradictory) to the predicate term in the
premise. Thus in Obversion only the predicate
term is changed. The original proposition/
premise is called the ‘Obvertend’ and Inferred
proposition/conclusion is called Obverse.

       Converse :
_________________________________
3.    No crows are sparrows.
       Converse :
_________________________________
4.    Many Ladies are hardworking.
       Converse :

There are certain rules of Obversion as
follows :

_________________________________
5.    Few voters are present.

(i)

       Converse :
_________________________________

Rule of Quality :

The quality of the Obverse (conclusion)
must change from the original proposition
(premise). If the premise is affirmative, the
conclusion must be negative and if the premise
is negative, the conclusion must be affirmative.

6.    All Tigers are wild.
       Converse :
_________________________________

(ii)

7.    Not a single cupboard is wooden.

Rule of Quantity :

The quantity of the Obverse (conclusion)
must remain the same as the original proposition
(premise). If the premise is Universal proposition,

       Converse :
_________________________________
46

the conclusion must also be Universal proposition
and if the premise is a particular proposition, the
conclusion must be a particular proposition.

4.

Some producers are not rich.

       Obverse :
_________________________________

(iii) Rule of Predicate term :

5.    Every mother is anxious.

The Predicate term of Obverse (conclusion)
must be complementary (contradictory) to
the Predicate term of the original proposition
(premise).

       Obverse :
_________________________________
6.    Not a single stick is straight.

Obversion can be explained with the
help of examples as follows :

Mediate Inference is a kind of Deductive
inference in which the conclusion is derived
from two or more premises considered jointly.
Syllogism is a form of Deductive inference,
but it is a Mediate inference, in which the
conclusion is derived from only two premises
taken jointly. There are three kinds of Syllogism.
They are as follows :

Hypothetical Syllogism,

(2)

Disjunctive Syllogism,

(3)

Categorical Syllogism.

(1)

Hypothetical Syllogism :

disjunctive proposition which states alternatives
and the second premise is the denial of the
first alternative of the disjunctive proposition.
From this one can derive the conclusion which
is the affirmation of second alternative of the
disjunctive proposition.

Hypothetical Syllogism is a deductive
argument in which both the premises are
hypothetical propositions, where the consequent
of the first proposition is same as the antecedent
of the second proposition. From this one can
derive a conclusion which is also a hypothetical
proposition, that contains the antecedent of the
first and consequent of the second proposition.

For example : Either Logicians are
Philosophers or Mathematicians.
Logicians are not Philosophers.
Therefore Logicians are Mathematician.
(3)

For example : If the country is kept
clean, then tourists will visit the country in large
numbers.

Categorical Syllogism is defined as
a deductive argument consisting of three
categorical propositions that together contain
exactly three terms, each of which occurs in
exactly two of the constituent propositions.

If tourists visit the country in large numbers,
then the country will progress financially.

For example : No doctors are lawyers.

Therefore if the country is kept clean, the
country will progress financially.
(2)

Categorical Syllogism :

Some professors are lawyers.

Disjunctive Syllogism :

Therefore some professors are not doctors.

Disjunctive Syllogism is a deductive
argument, in which the first premise is a

Summary
The Greek Philosopher Aristotle is the founder of Traditional Logic.
Term is defined as a word or group of words which stands as the subject and predicate of a
logical proposition.
A proposition has three elements subject - copula - predicate.
Traditionally proposition is classified into (1) Conditional proposition and (2) Categorical
proposition.
Conditional propositions is of two types :
(1) Hypothetical proposition and (2) Disjunctive proposition.
(2) Categorical proposition is classified into four kinds namely A, E, I, O.
On the basis of quantity the propositions are classified as Universal and Particular.
On the basis of quality the propositions are classified as Affirmative and Negative.
Thus there are four kinds of propositions :
(1) Universal Affirmative, (2) Universal Negative, (3) Particular Affirmative, and (4) Particular
Negative.
48

In ‘A’, the subject term is distributed and the predicate term is undistributed.
In ‘E’, both the subject term and the predicate term are distributed.
In ‘I’, both the subject term and the predicate term are undistributed.
In ‘O’, the subject term is undistributed whereas the predicate term is distributed.
A term is distributed when it refers to the entire clas and it is undistributed when it does not
refers to the entire class but to the part of the class.
Inference are of two types (1) Immediate and (2) Mediate.
Immediate Inference is of two types (1) Opposition of Proposition and (2) Eduction.
Opposition of proposition is the relation between categorical propositions having the same
subject and predicate but differing in quantity, quality or both quantity and quality. There are
four kinds of oppositions:
(1) Contradictory, (2) Contrary, (3) Sub-contrary and (4) Sub-altern.
Eduction is of two types : (1) Conversion and (2) Obversion
In Conversion the subject and predicate are interchanged.
The quality of the converse remains the same and no term is distributed in converse until it is
distributed in the premise.
Thus : In Categorical proposition,
Converse of SAP is PIS.
Converse of SEP is PES.
Converse of SIP is PIS.
Converse of SOP is not possible.
In Obversion the predicate of the obverse is complementary to the original proposition.
In Obversion the quantity of Obverse remains the same but its quality changes.
Thus : Obverse of SAP is SEP.
           Obverse of SEP is SAP.
           Obverse of SIP is SOP.
           Obverse of SOP is SIP.

Syllogism
For example :

In the previous chapter we have studied the
meaning of Mediate inference. We already know
that Syllogism is an mediate inference. In this
chapter we will deal with Categorical Syllogism.

All fruits are ripe.
All apples are fruits.
Therefore all apples are ripe.

Categorical Syllogism in general is a
deductive argument, in which the conclusion
cannot assert more than what is asserted in the
premises.

In the above syllogism the first two
propositions are the premises and the third
proposition is the conclusion.

Let us have two categorical propositions
as premises.

As a mediate inference, syllogism differs
from immediate inference. Unlike eductions
and opposition of propositions, the conclusion
of syllogism is deduced from the two premises
taken jointly. It is not deducted from each of the
premises, separately.

Some Indians are Honest.
No Indians are fools.
Which conclusion given below is the
correct one, that follows from the above
two premises?
1.

Some Indians are fools.

2.

Some honest persons are not fools.

5.2 Structure of Categorical Syllogism :
In a Categorical syllogism, the constituent
propositions are analysed into terms. The
predicate term of the conclusion is called the
major term. It is represented by ‘P’ and the
Subject term of the conclusion is called the
minor term. It is represented by ‘S’. The term
which occurs in both the premises, but not in
the conclusion is called the middle term. It is
represented by ‘M’.

5.1 Categorical Syllogism
The theory of Categorical Syllogism was
put forward by Aristotle.
Categorical syllogism is defined as
a deductive argument consisting of three
categorical propositions that together contain
exactly three terms, each of which occurs in only
two of the constituent propositions.

The premise in which the major term
occurs is called major premise and the premise
in which the minor term occurs is called minor
premise. Middle term relates the major and minor
terms. The relation between the middle term and
the other two terms is either of affirmation or
negation.

According to Aristotle, Categorical
Syllogism is an argument in which the middle
term stands in a certain relation to the other two
terms. i.e. the Subject term and the Predicate
term.

Categorical Syllogism is a formal
inference. Its validity does not depend on the
content of, either the premise or the conclusion.
Hence syllogistic argument can be represented
symbolically, and its validity is decided on the
basis of formal relation between the premises
and the conclusion. If the premises imply the
conclusion, the inference is valid and if they
do not imply the conclusion, the inference is
invalid.

It is a mediate inference in which
the conclusion is deduced from two given
propositions.

54

Figure - III : It is the form of Categorical
syllogism in which the middle term stands as
the subject in both the premises, i.e. major and
minor premise.

The validity of Categorical syllogism
does not depend on the order of the constituent
propositions in an given argument. But when
the syllogism is reduced to its logical form the
constituent propositions are expressed in certain
order as follows :

		 M P
		 M S

Major Premise

\ S

Minor Premise

P

Figure - IV : It is the form of Categorical
syllogism in which the middle term stands as the
predicate in the major premise and as a subject
in minor premise.

Conclusion
5.3 Figures of Categorical Syllogism
Categorical Syllogisms differ from each
other depending upon the position of the middle
term in the premises. The middle term may stand
as the subject or the predicate in the premises.
There are three kinds of syllogism depending
on the position of middle term in the premises.
They are called figures. Galen has added the
fourth figure to the syllogism. Thus there are
four figures of syllogism. Figures of syllogism
is the form of syllogism as determined by the
position of the middle term in the premises.

5.4 Rules of Categorical Syllogism

		 M P

Traditional logicians observed that one
can test the validity of syllogistic arguments by
applying certain rules. A Categorical syllogism
whose conclusion is drawn in accordance with
these rules would be valid. If the Categorical
syllogism violates any of these rules, it would be
invalid. A violation of any one rule is a mistake,
of specific kind. So when a Categorical syllogism
is invalid, it is said to commit a fallacy. It is a
mistake in the form of an argument, so it is called
as formal fallacy. Each of these formal fallacies
has a traditional name, explained below:

		 S M

Rule : 1

The figures of Categorical syllogism are as
follows :
Figure - I : It is the form of Categorical
syllogism in which the middle term stands as the
subject of major premise and predicate of minor
premise.

\ S

(1)

P

Figure - II : It is the form of Categorical
syllogism in which the middle term stands as
the predicate in both the premises i.e. major and
minor premise.

Syllogism in general must contain three
and only three propositions.

Syllogism is defined as a kind of mediate
inference, consisting of two premises which
together determine the truth of the conclusion.
This definition shows that a syllogism has two
premises and one conclusion. i.e. it has, in
total only three propositions. If the number of
premises are more than two, then its ceases to
be a syllogism.

Distribution of terms in Categorical propositions:

All men are mortal.

Categorical Subject term
Predicate
Propositions
term
A
Distributed Undistributed
E
Distributed
Distributed
I
Undistributed Undistributed
O
Undistributed Distributed

All men are animals.
All animals are living beings.
Therefore all living beings are mortal.
The above argument has three premises
and a conclusion. i.e. total four propositions so
the argument is fallacious and such fallacy is
called as Argument of Sorites.
(2)

Rule : 2
(1)

There must be three and only three
terms in a Categorical syllogism

Rules of Distribution of Terms :

The middle term must be distributed
atleast once in the premises.

The function of middle term in a Categorical
syllogism is to unite the major term and the
minor term. The middle term cannot perform
this function, unless it is distributed atleast once
in the premises. A term is distributed when it
refers to the whole class and is undistributed
when it refers to the part of the class.

Every valid categorical syllogism must
involve three terms - no more and no less. If more
than three terms are involved, the Categorical
syllogism is invalid. The fallacy thus committed
is called the fallacy of four terms. This happens
especially when one of the terms is ambiguous.
i.e. it is used in two different senses. Actually
speaking the word is ambiguous, not the term.
A term has definite and fixed meaning. A word
becomes a term when it stands as subject or
predicate in a proposition. When the word
becomes a term, it cannot have more than one
meaning. When the term is used ambiguously
it is called the fallacy of Equivocation.

The violation of this rule commits the
fallacy of Undistributed middle.
For Example :
(i)

All metals are heavy.
All stones are heavy.
Therefore All stones are metals.

In the above argument the middle term, i.e.
‘heavy’ stands as the predicate of ‘A’ proposition,
in both the premises. So in both the premises
the middle term ‘heavy’ is undistributed. Since
the middle term is not distributed, it is possible
that the part of the middle term which is related
to the major premise may not be the part
which is related to the minor premise. That is
why the middle term is not able to perform its
function of relating two terms. So the fallacy of
Undistributed middle is committed.

For example :
Any bell rings.
Some rings are beautiful.
Therefore Some bells are beautiful.
In the above example the Middle term
‘Rings’ is ambiguous, it means ‘sound’ in the
Major premise and ‘ornament in the Minor
premise.
The fallacy of equivocation may be
committed with regard to any of the three terms.
These are called fallacy of : (1) Ambiguous
major, (2) Ambiguous middle and (3) Ambiguous
minor.

(2)

No term can be distributed in the
conclusion, unless it is distributed in the
premise.

When a term is distributed in the conclusion
but not distributed in the premises, means that
the conclusion has gone beyond the evidence in
56

its premises and the argument being deductive
is therefore invalid. This mistake is called the
fallacy of illicit process of terms.

State which formal fallacy is committed
in the Syllogistic argument, given below?
Why?

There are two terms in the conclusion.
These are the minor term and the major term.

No men are quadruped.
Some men are tall.

Accordingly the two types of fallacies that
arise are :

Therefore no tall beings are quadruped.

(1)

Fallacy of illicit minor,

____________________________________

(2)

Fallacy of illicit major.

____________________________________

1.

Fallacy of illicit minor :

Rule : 3

For example :
(i)

(1)

No cowards are brave. (Major Premise)

Therefore no unreliable people are brave.
The minor term ‘unreliable’ is undistributed
in the minor premise since it is the predicate
of ‘A’ proposition, but it is distributed in the
conclusion, being the subject of ‘E’ proposition.
Hence the Fallacy of illicit Minor is committed.
Fallacy of illicit Major :

For example :

When the major term is distributed in
the conclusion but not distributed in the major
premise, the fallacy of illicit major is committed.

(i)

No Lotus are roses. (Negative)
Some flowers are not roses. (Negative)

For example :
(i)

No conclusion can be drawn from two
negative premises.

Any negative proposition i.e. ‘E’ and ‘O’
denies the class inclusion. It asserts that all/
some members of one class are excluded from
the other class. i.e. the subject or predicate of the
conclusion is wholly or partially excluded from
the class of Middle term in negative premises.
Two premises asserting exclusion cannot
justify the relation between the premises and
the conclusion and therefore the argument is
invalid. This fallacy is as named as fallacy of
Negative premises (or Exclusive premises.)

All cowards are unreliable. (Minor
					
Premise)

2.

Rules of Quality :

Therefore some flowers are not Lotus.

All mammals are animals (Major Premise)

Since in the above argument conclusion is
drawn from two negative premises so the rule is
violated and the fallecy of Negative Premises is
committed.

No mammals are birds (Minor Premise)
Therefore no birds are animals.
In the above argument the major term
‘animals is undistributed in the Major premise.’
but it is distributed in the conclusion. Hence the
fallacy of illicit major is committed.

(2)

When either of the premises is negative,
the conclusion must be negative and vice
versa.

In the negative propositions, one of the two
classes, S or P, is wholly or partly excluded from
each other. Whereas in affirmative propositions,
one of the two classes S or P, is wholly or partly
included in the other. Affirmative proposition
57

is knowledge (mana) which arises after (anu)
other knowledge. Indian logicians generally
make distinction between inference for one self
(Swartha) and inference for others (Parartha)
i.e. inference used for demonstrating truth for
other people. In inference for oneself we do not
require any formal presentation of the different
propositions of an inference. It is a psychological
process. Inference for others is a syllogism.
For Nyaya school of Indian philosophy
inference consists of five propositions/members
(Avayavas) and is for demonstrating truth for
others, The five propositions of Nyaya syllogism
are -

can be inferred only if the premises asserts the
existence of a third class which includes the first
class, that has the second class already included
in it. This is possible only when both the premises
are affirmative propositions.
When the above rule is violated then the
fallacy of drawing an affirmative conclusion
from a negative premise is committed.
For example :
No artists are hardworking. (Negative)
Some potters are artists
Therefore some potters are hardworking.
(Affirmative)
Since in the above argument the major
premise is negative, but the conclusion is
affirmative so the argument is Invalid, fallacy
of an affirmative conclusion from a negative
premise is committed.
(3)

When both the premises are affirmative
then the Conclusion must be affirmative
& vice versa.
For example :
All men are animals.

1.

Statement of the proposition to be proved.
(Pratijna)

2.

Statement of the reason. (Hetu)

3.

Statement of the universal proposition
called Vyapti along with an example.
(Udaharan)

4.

Statement of the presence of the mark/
hetu i.e. reason in the case in question.
(Upanaya)

5.

Conclusion proved. (Nigaman)

The following is a typical example of
Nyaya syllogism -

All animals are mortal.
Therefore all men are mortal.

1.

This hill has fire. (Pratijna)

2.

Because it has smoke. (Hetu)

3.

Wherever there is smoke there is fire as in
the kitchen. (Udaharan)

4.

This hill has smoke which is invariably
associated with fire. (Upanaya)

Therefore all Americans are Indians.

5.

Therefore this hill has fire. (Nigaman)

___________________________________

Like Aristotelian syllogism, the Nyaya
syllogism also has three terms. The major term
is called sadhya, the minor term is called paksha
and the middle term is called ling or hetu. In the
above example, hill is the minor term, fire is the
major term and smoke is the middle term. From
the presence of smoke in the hill as qualified
by the knowledge that wherever there is smoke
there is fire, one proceeds to infer the presence

State which formal fallacy is committed
in the Syllogistic argument, given below?
Why?
All Indians are Asians.
No Asians are American.

5.5 Aristotelian Syllogism and Indian
Nyaya Syllogism
In Indian logic, Inference is called
Anumana and is defined as that cognition
which presupposes some other cognition. It

and formal and material at the same time. For
Nyaya thinkers deduction and induction are
two aspects of the same process and cannot
be separated. Inference according to Nyaya, is
neither from the universal to the particular nor
from the particular to the universal, but from the
particular to the particular through the universal.

of fire on the hill. The knowledge of universal
concomitance i.e. invariable association of
smoke with fire is known as vyapti.
Aristotelian syllogism and Nyaya
syllogism both have three terms, however, they
differ in number of propositions it contains.
Aristotelian syllogism has three propositions
whereas Nyaya syllogism has five propositions.
According to many Indian as well as western
logician this difference is a nominal difference
and both the syllogisms are fundamentally
similar. The difference lies more in the form than
in the essence. Out of five propositions is Nyaya
syllogism, two appear redundant. One can reduce
the Nyaya syllogism to three propositions either
by removing first two or last two propositions as
given below.

The udaharan or example (...as in the
kitchen) in the third proposition is a unique
feature of Nyaya syllogism which illustrates
the truth that, the universal major premise is the
result of a real induction based on the law of
causation. The udaharan shows how deduction
and induction are inseparable in Nyaya syllogism
and also how it is both formal and material.
Udaharan is also a very strong point as
Dr. Radhakrishnan says, against the argument
that the Nyaya syllogism is influenced by the
Greek thought. Secondly we find development
of the Nyaya inference before Aristotle. The
similarities between the two are due to parallel
development of thought.

(A)
1.

Wherever there is smoke there is fire as in
the kitchen. (Udaharan) - Major premise

2.

This hill has smoke which is invariably
associated with fire. (Upanaya) - Minor
premise

3.

(2) In the Aristotelian syllogism, though
connected by the middle term, the major and
the minor terms stand apart in the premises.
In the Nyaya syllogism all the three terms
stand synthesized in the upanaya i.e. fourth
proposition.

Therefore this hill has fire. (Nigaman) Conclusion

(B)
1.

This hill has fire. (Pratijna) - Conclusion

2.

Because it has smoke. (Hetu) - Minor
premise

3.

Wherever there is smoke there is fire as in
the kitchen. (Udaharan) - Major premise.

(3) Propositions of Aristotelian syllogism
are nothing more than the absolutely necessary
constituent parts of an inference. Propositions of
Nyaya syllogism on the other hand constitute a
fully reasoned out argument whose parts follow
one after another in their natural sequence.

The first syllogism (A) resembles the
Aristotelian syllogism in the first figure.

(4) The Nyaya syllogism is expository and
rhetorical. It is the actual method followed in
debate and therefore more useful in discovering
the conclusion. The Aristotelian syllogism on
the other hand is analytical and better fitted to
test validity of inference.

Apart from the similarities there are also
some differences between Aristotelian and
Nyaya Syllogism. These are as given below.
(1) Aristotelian syllogism is deductive and
formal. Nyaya syllogism is deductive - inductive

In syllogistic argument the conclusion is drawn from two premises taken jontly.
Categorical syllogism has three terms. Minor term i.e. subject, Major term i.e. Predicate and the
Middle term. The function of middle term is to connect major and minor term.
Syllogistic argument is a deductive infernece, and has formal validity.
Galen added fourth figure to Categorical syllogism.
Therefore there are four figures of Categorical syllogism :Figure - I

Rules of Categorical syllogisms :
There are four rules of Categorical syllogism given by Aristotle.
Rule - 1 Rules of structure :
(1)

Syllogism must contain three and only three propositions.

(2)

There must be three and only three terms in a syllogism.

Rule - 2 Rules of Distribution of terms :
(1)

The middle term must be distributed atleast once in the premises.

(2)

No term can be distributed in the conclusion, unless it is distributed in the Premise. i.e.
[Subject term or Predicate term]

Rule - 3 Rules of Quality :
(1)

No conclusion can be drawn from two negative premises.

(2)

When one of the premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative and vice versa.

(3)

when both the premises are Affirmative the conclusion must be affirmative vice versa.
60

If the syllogistic argument violates any of these rules, then it commits the formal fallacy.
Seven Formal fallacies in Categorical Syllogism are as follows :
(1)

Fallacy of Argument of Sorites

(2)

Fallacy of Four terms. (Equivocation).

(3)

Fallacy of undistributed Middle.

(4)

Fallacy of illicit Minor

(5)

Fallacy of illicit Major

(6)

Fallacy of Negative Premises (Exclusive) Premises.

(7)

Fallacy of Drawing an Affirmative conclusion from a Neagtive premise.
Aristotalian Logic and Nyaya Logic :

In Indian logic, Inference is called Anumana and is defined as that cognition which presupposes
some other cognition. It is knowledge (mana) which arises after (anu) other knowledge.
For Nyaya school of Indian phiolsophy inference consists of five propositions/members
(Avayavas) and is for demonstrating truth for others, The five propositions of Nyaya syllogism
are (1)

Statement of the proposition to be proved. (Pratijna)

(2)

Statement of the reason. (Hetu)

(3)

Statement of the universal proposition called Vyapti along with an example. (Udaharan)

(4)

Statement of the presence of the mark/hetu i.e. reason in the case in question. (Upanaya)

(5)

Conclusion proved. (Nigaman)

Both Nyaya and Aristotelian Syllogism has three terms unlike Aristotelian, Nyaya has five
propositions but both are essentially similar.
One can reduce the Nyaya syllogism to three propositions either by removing first two or last
two propositions.
Apart from the similarities there are also some differences between Aristotelian and Nyaya
Syllogism. These are as given below.
1.

Aristotelian syllogism is deductive and formal. Nyaya syllogism is deductive - inductive and
formal and material at the same time.

2.

In the Aristotelian syllogism, though connected by the middle term, the major and the minor
terms stand apart in the premises. In the Nyaya syllogism all the three terms stand synthesized
in the upanaya i.e. fourth proposition.

3.

Propositions of Aristotelian syllogism are nothing more than the absolutly necessary
constituent parts of an inference, but Nyaya Syllogism constitute of fully reasoned out
argument in natural sequence.

4.

The Aristotelian syllogism is good for testing the validity of inference, where as Nyaya syllogism
being an actual method followed in debate, is more useful in discovering the conclusion.

Grounds of Induction

DO YOU KNOW THAT ..............
l

There is a difference between perception and observation.

l

Observation needs training.

l

Science involves experiments that can be repeated by others.

Introduction

Thus on the basis of these two principles,
the Inductive Leap is justified.

The aim of the scientific investigation
is to understand the nature of the universe.
When a scientist observes nature, certain facts
are clear to him; whereas certain facts are not.
They explain these problems by discovering
different laws and establishing theories. Laws
in science are established by induction, which
proceed from observed to unobserved, known
to unknown, where the evidence is about some
cases but the conclusion is about all cases,
such a leap from ‘some to all’ is called as an
Inductive Leap which makes the conclusion of
an argument probable. Hence there is a need to
justify Inductive Leap.

(b)

The aim of induction in science is to arrive
at laws or theories on the basis of particular
facts. Science aims at establishing the material or
empirical truth of laws. For this, formal ground
is not enough. Material truth of empirical laws
is established by the methods of observation and
experiment. Therefore these methods are called
material grounds of induction. They provide the
initial data to scientist for enquiry.
6.1 Observation
The word observation is derived from two
Greek words, ‘Ob’ means ‘before’ and ‘server’
means ‘To keep’. So observation literally means
‘keeping something before the mind’.

Inductive leap is justified on two grounds,
namely, formal grounds of induction and material
ground of induction
(a)

Formal Grounds of induction

One gets knowledge of the world around
us through the five sense organs. Whenever
one looks around one notices many objects and
their qualities. This is perception. Perception
is to become aware of objects and events
that happen to come to our notice. There is
no definite purpose in perception and it is not
deliberately chosen. So perception differs from
observation due to these characteristics.

Principle of uniformity of nature and
Principle of Causation are called ‘Formal
grounds of Induction’.
(i)

The principle of uniformity of nature :

It states that there is an order in nature.
Whatever happens once will always happen
again under similar circumstances. So on the
basis of this principle; it is justified in arguing
that what is true of some case of a kind is true of
all the cases of that kind.
(ii)

Material Grounds of induction :

For example : when one passes by a
corridor besides a chemistry laboratory, one
becomes aware of some smells; one listens and
hears sounds of various kinds. But this is not
observation. It is mere perception.

The principle of causation

It states that some events in nature are
causally connected and causal relation is
invariable i.e. the same cause always leads to the
same effect.
67

Observation is defined as selective
perception of facts with a certain purpose.

So every observations is perception but
every perception is not observation unlike
perception observation is purposive and
selective.

6.2 Difference between observation and Perception :
Observation

				

Perception

(1)

It has a definite purpose.

(1)

It is without any definite purpose.

(2)

It involves selection of facts.

(2)

There is no selection of facts.

(3)

Everything that is observed is Perceived.

(3)

Everything that is perceived is

				not observed
6.3 Characteristics of observation :

possible to observe all the aspects of facts. The
observer therefore focuses attention only on the
significant aspects of a fact, which are relevant
to the hypothesis under consideration.

Observation is done by common man as
well as scientist but the scientific observation
is systematic. It is the foundation of scientific
investigation.

For example : When a doctor visits
his patient he observes his blood pressure,
temperature, heart beats etc., as they are significant
aspects for patient’s health. Whereas a friend or
a relative of the patient equally concerned about
him may not observe these aspects. So though
the fact (the patient) observed is the same, the
aspect of facts considered significant can differ
with each observer.

Following are the characteristics of
observation.
(1)

Observation is purposive :

When the scientist proceeds to observe
nature he does so with a definite purpose. The
main purpose is to collect data or facts, on the
basis of which one can either prove or disprove
a theory.

(4)

Thus it is purposive. e.g. Discovery of
Neptune.
(2)

Our sense organs are means of observing
facts. Sometimes our senses can deceive us and
we may experience illusions.

Observation is selection of significant
facts :

For example : A stick looks bent when a
part of it is immersed in water. This experience
is an illusory aspect of fact and one should
overlook it as a matter of optical illusion which
is due to the refraction of sun rays. This needs to
be neglected during observation.

Observation is selective. Selection of facts
is determined by the observer’s purpose. From
the countless facts in the world, scientists select
to observe only those facts which are relevant to
the problem under study. He observes only those
significant facts that would help him to either
establish or reject the suggested hypothesis.
(3)

The observer has to neglect the illusory
aspects of a fact :

Observation is selection of a significant
aspect of fact :

Facts are vast and complex. There are
many aspects to facts. It is neither necessary nor
68

(5)

(2)

Use of instruments in observation :

Observation depends on one’s sense
organs. But the capacity of the sense organs
is limited, so various instruments are used in
science to extend the limits of sense organs.

sense

organs

and

If the sense organs are defective, one
cannot observe correctly. The conclusions
derived on the basis of such observation will
not be reliable. So the sense organs should be
healthy.

For example : Telescope, Microscope,
Sonography, X-ray etc.

Sense organs have limited range of
perception. For example : One cannot perceive
an object very clearly, if it is too far such as
planets or too minute particle like bacteria in
water. In such cases use of powerful scientific
instruments becomes necessary and valuable.
Even the powerful instruments used in
science have certain limitations. Therefore while
doing observation scientist should consider
the limitations of both sense organs as well as
instruments.

6.4 Conditions of good observation :
Good observation is important in scientific
investigation. Erroneous or bad observation
can lead to wrong conclusion in science. It is
therefore necessary to know the conditions of
good observation which are as follows:
(1)

Limitation of
instruments :

(3)

External conditions :

The scientist should take into account
all possible external conditions under which
observation is done. The external conditions or
the environment can affect the observation of
the fact.

Mental set and intellectual condition :

The observer should have inquisitiveness
and craving for knowledge. Scientist should
be mentally alert, attentive, active, free from
prejudices, scientist must possess intellectual
abilities to understand, explore and explain
natural phenomena. To avoid bias and
prejudices, the observer should observe all the
facts and record them, whether they appear to
be important or not. Test of ‘public verifiability’
and ‘general consensibility’ are another way
of avoiding bias and partial observation. This
means the observational record of one scientist
is checked and verified by other scientists or one
can make some more observations.

For example : During winter season, due
to excess fog, one may not be able to see the
road

The scientist should also have openness
and patience to wait for favourable conditions to
occur under which observation is possible.

The observation is accurate, if the observer
is aware of the external conditions and is able to
assess their influence on the observation.

69

(4)

Training in the techniques of
observation :

(b)

Accurate or good observation is a
necessary condition of scientific inquiry. For
scientific observation, training in the techniques
of observation is necessary.

6.5 Fallacies of observation :
Correct and precise observation is the key
to success in scientific investigation. If conditions
of good observation are not satisfied it can result
in erroneous or fallacious observation.

Training helps scientists in following ways :
(a)

It also helps them in deciding, when, how
and which scientific instruments are to be
used.

It helps the observer to know what to
observe, when to observe, where to
observe and how to observe.

Fallacies of observation
↓
			

Non observation

Neglect of instance

Mal observation

Neglect of operative conditions

There are two types of fallacies that occur
in observation. 			

(ii)

(A) Fallacies of Non- observation :
Fallacy of non-observation arises when
an observer overlooks or ignores the relevant
facts or circumstances, which should have been
observed.

(iii) Due to biased attitude.
For example : It is human tendency to
consider and give importance to those
facts which are in favour and ignore those
which are unfavourable.

There are two ways in which this fallacy
may occur.
(1)

Fallacy of Non observation due to the
neglect of instances :

(2)

Neglect of instances is a fallacy in
which either knowingly or unknowingly the
observer, overlooks the relevant instances for
investigation. Neglect of instances can take
place due to various reasons :
(i)

Due to narrow range of experience.
For example : Human beings cannot hear
sounds below the range of about 20 Hertz,
which the bats can hear.

Fallacy of Non observation due to
neglect of operative Conditions :

This fallacy consists in neglecting essential
and relevant circumstances and conditions
responsible for the occurrence of a phenomenon.
Instead of the real cause some other conditions
are considered as the cause of a particular effect.

Due to unfavorable physical conditions.
For example : Non-observation of Sun
during solar eclipse.

For example : Digby’s sympathetic
powder :In the 17th Century, Digby’s sympathetic
powder attracted great attention. When a person
was wounded, the instructions were, ‘to keep the
wound clean and to rub the powder to a knife
or a sword’. It was found that the wound was
cured. This made people believe that, ‘applying
the powder to a knife or sword’, was the cause
70

of curing the wounds. But the real cause was
‘keeping the wound clean’, which was neglected.

(c)

(B)

A peculiar mental state of the observer
may result in wrong interpretation of the sense
impression.

Fallacy of Mal-Observation :

Fallacy of Mal-observation consists
in interpreting sense impressions wrongly.
In such cases of observation, an object is
observed as something else. This is the fallacy
of misinterpretation. In short it is the fallacy of
mistaking one thing for another thing.

For example : After watching a horror
movie, the person waking up in the middle of
the night may misinterpret white shirt hanging
in the room as a ghost due to fear.
6.6 Experiment :

For example : Mistaking a rope as a snake.

Experiment is also a material ground
of Induction. Experiment is defined as
‘observation under conditions controlled by
the investigator’.

Mal-observation arises due to following
reasons:
(a)

Unfavorable physical conditions :
For example :

(1)

The peculiar mental state of the
observer:

In observation, the facts are observed
under natural conditions. The facts can be
observed just once because we have no control
over natural conditions. Hence the investigator
prefers to observe those facts, which are under
his control.

Perception of a mirage in a desert, where
one interprets sand as water.

Observation gives us information, but
it may not be always adequate or sufficient to
study the phenomenon thoroughly, so scientists
perform experiments.
(b)

Experiment is keen, careful, systematic
observation made under conditions artificially
created and controlled by the investigator.

Observer’s lack of experience :

If the observer is not experienced, he may
wrongly interpret the sense impression.

6.7 Nature of Experiment :
Experiment is conducted with a definite
purpose. The purpose of any experiment is to
find out the effect of one factor on another factor.

For example :
(1)

A baby plays with one’s own image in
the mirror, thinking that .there is another
baby, and a baby cannot distinguish
between person and the image due to lack
of experience.

A variable is a factor that can change.
There are three kinds of variables :
(i)

Independent variable.

(ii)

Dependent variable.

(iii) Relevant / Controlled variable.

71

(i)

Independent variable :

6.8 Characteristics of Experiment :

Independent variable is that factor
whose effect the experimenter wishes to study.
Hence by keeping the other conditions or factors
constant, only independent variable is varied.
(increased decreased or withdrawn) and then its
effect is studied.

(1)

For example : If one is trying to determine
which type of laundry soap removes the most
dirt, one would test a variety of different
kinds of soaps. The type of soap would be the
Independent variable and one would change it
each time when one conducts an experiment.

(2)

(ii)

Experiment is a deliberately
undertaken :

Experiment is deliberately conducted
either to collect data or to explore a relationship,
or to test a hypothesis.
Experiment involves setting up an
artificial situation :

If the scientist wants to observe different
aspects of the phenomenon carefully, he cannot do
so in the natural setting because the phenomenon
is surrounded by many circumstances which
are complex and are accompanied by many
conditions some of which are irrelevent and
obstructing.

Dependent variable :

The effect of independent variable is
called dependent variable. Thus it is a variable
which gets affected by the independent variable.

So the experimenter creates an artifical
sitiuation where he can find out the effect of one
factor at a time by keeping other relvant factors
constant.

For example : when one tests each type
of laundry soap, one will measure, how much
dirt is left. The amount of dirt remaining each
time when one does the experiment, would be
the dependent variables.

For example : A coin is observed to
fall faster than feather in air. But to prove that
the weight of object has no relation with the
acceleration with which the object falls to the
ground, the scientist had to set up an artificial
condition. i.e. he eliminated ‘air’ which is an
irrelevant and obstructing condition and a
vaccum was created, then the coin and feather
was found to fall with equal acceleration in
vaccum.

(iii) Relevant or Controlled variable :
The experimenter keeps the relevant
or controlled variable constant. Relevant or
controlled variable is one which has a capacity
to influence the dependent variable. It can
affect the outcome of the experiment.
For example : Apart from the type of
soap, there are other relevant variables which
can influence the removal of dirt from the
clothes. Unless these variables are controlled,
the result will not be accurate. Hence the
experimenter has to keep all the relevant or
controlled variables constant such as the amount
of water, water temperature, the time spent in
washing, the amount of soap, the amount of dirt
on clothes etc., and see the effect of independent
variable (Type of soap) on dependent variable.
(Removing of maximum dirt from the clothes)

(3)

Experiment
involves
variation of conditions :

systematic

When scientists conduct an experiment
they wish to find out the effect of one factor at
a time. Hence there is a need to conrol all other
relevant factors except the factor whose effect
one wants to study. This factor is then increased
or decreased to determine it’s exact influence.

72

(4)

Experiment can be repeated :

characterstic of experiment. The experiment can
be repeated by any one, any place & at any time
to confirm the result of the experiment.

The experimenter can repeat the
experiment, because the experimenter has
control over the conditions this is an important

Summary
Scientist uses inductive arguments to establish generalizations (laws) as well as theories.
Inductive arguments involve inductive leap which is justified by the principle of uniformity of
nature and the principle of causation which are called ‘formal grounds of induction’.
Science aims at establishing the material truth of a generalization or law which is assured
by material grounds. An observation and experiment are means of collecting facts in science,
they are called ‘material grounds of Induction’.
Observation is different from the perception of object. Perception means becoming aware
of objects which happens to come to our notice. Perception is not selective and it is not grounded
by any purpose. Observation on the other hand is, ‘Selective perception of facts with a certain
purpose’.
Characteristics of observation :
(1) Observation is purposive.
(2) Observation is selection of significant facts.
(3) Observation is selection of a significant aspects of fact.
(4) Observation is to neglect the illusory aspects of a fact.
(5) Use of instruments in observation.
Conditions of good observation :
(1) Mental set and Intellectual condition.
(2) Limitation of sense organs and instruments.
(3) External conditions.
(4) Training in the techniques of observation.
Fallacies of observation
They are of 2 types :
(1) Fallacy of Non-observation –
(a) Neglect of instance
(b) Neglect of operative conditions
(2) Fallacy of Mal -Observation
Experiment :
Experiment is keen, careful, systematic observation made under conditions artificially
created and controlled by the investigator.

74

Characteristics of Experiment :
(1) Experiment is deliberately undertaken.
(2) Experiment involves setting up of an artificial situation.
(3) Experiment involves systematic variation of conditions.

Hypothesis

7.1 Introduction

7.3 Characteristics of Hypothesis

In scientific method, one of the  important
step is formulation of a hypothesis when
scientists are faced with a situation or a problem
which they are not able to understand and explain
then the scientific inquiry begins.

(1)

It is an important stage in scientific
investigation :

Every scientific investigation starts with
the problem for which scientist intends to find
solution. He begins by assuming a possible
explanation on the basis of which he starts
investigation. Hypothesis is like guiding post
which gives direction to scientific investigation.
No scientific investigation is possible without
hypothesis. Unless a hypothesis is formed
scientists would not know what facts to observe
and what experiments to conduct in order to find
the solution to the problem.

Scientific investigation may be either in the
field of natural sciences like physics, chemistry
or social sciences like Sociology, Anthropology
etc., when scientist observe nature they come
across certain facts, events or situations which
they are not able to explain. These are problems
faced by scientist. Feeling of a problem is the
starting point of scientific investigation. Next
important step is to formulate a hypothesis.
Unless a hypothesis is formed scientific
investigation cannot proceed further. Thus,
hypothesis gives a direction to scientific
investigation and is an important step in
scientific investigation.

For example : Discovery of Neptune.
Astronomers had calculated the orbit of
planet Uranus, on the basis of the gravitational
pull of then known planets. But, in 1820,
scientists Bouvard observed that there was a
deviation in this calculated orbit. Astronomers
advanced the hypothesis that there is a
planet beyond Uranus which is disturbing the
gravitational force of Uranus.

It is therefore necessary to know what
hypothesis is and how it is established in science.
7.2 Definition and Nature of hypothesis
Scientist’s investigation begins with the
formation of hypothesis. The word hypothesis
is derived from the Greek word  ‘hypo’ which
means ‘under’ and ‘thithenai’ means ‘to place’.

The great Berlin telescope was turned
towards that direction and they found the planet.
This planet was named Neptune. Hence the
hypothesis was verified to be true.

Coffey defines hypothesis as “An attempt
at explanation, a provisional supposition made
in order to explain scientifically some facts or
phenomenon.”

(2)

Attempts at explanation

Hypothesis is an attempt at explaining
observed facts which scientist are unable to
explain. Hypothesis does not explain the fact
unless it is verified to be true. On the basis of this
possible explanation the investigator proceeds
to collect data through observation and may use
the experiment to verify it. Once the hypothesis
is verified it becomes the explanation of the
problem.

In simple words hypothesis is defined as
a tentative solution given to the problem.
For  e.g - Since childhood, Edward Jenner had
heard that in spite of getting cow pox blisters
on their hands, milkmaids did not develop small
pox. To explain this situation, he formulated a
hypothesis that ‘the pus in the blisters might have
protected the milkmaids from small pox.’ This
was a provisional supposition. Thus hypothesis
is a guess work as to how facts are connected.

(3)

Provisional :

Every hypothesis is always provisional in
character. It is suggested as a likely solution. It
78

is merely a tentative supposition or suggestion
or simply a claim to explain the fact. It may turn
out to be a right explanation or may turn out to
be a wrong one. There is no finality about the
solution provided by it.
(4)

destination. Nicolas wondered about the why
and how of this event. A thought came to his
mind that if the food is boiled and sealed in a
glass jar with a cork then it may not get spoilt. He
conducted an experiment to test this hypothesis
and found that the food did not get spoilt, as the
germs in the food were killed by boiling the food
and also outside germs could not enter the food
as the glass jar was sealed with the cork.

It is an organising principle -

The aim of science is to understand and
explain facts. This is done by introducing order
in facts.
In fact there is an order in nature but this
order cannot be perceived the way in which one
can perceive facts. One has to find out this order.
This is what science attempts to do. At initial
stage of scientific inquiry one fails to understand
the connection between innumerable facts and
events in nature. Facts appear to be scattered,
isolated and unrelated to each other. But once
the hypothesis   is verified to be true, the order
among the facts is revealed. Therefore, it is an
organising principle.

Inventor of the food
preservation process (Canning)
This hypothesis which resulted from
Nicolas Appert’s creative imagination lead to
the invention of canned food.

For example : Before Newton discovered
the theory of gravitation, there appeared to be
no connection between facts like - freely falling
objects, movements of planets, phenomena
of tides. His theory of gravitation revealed the
connection between these apparently unrelated
facts and showed that they were all due to
gravitation.
(5)

7.4 Origin / suggestion of hypothesis :
Hypothesis is a tentative supposition that
is formulated in order to solve the problem
and to explain the related fact and phenomena.
However, there are no rules that guide how
to formulate a hypothesis. Study of various
discoveries by scientist give us clues as to how
hypotheses are suggested to scientist. Following
are some important factors which may suggest
hypothesis to scientist.  

Result of rational activity :

In order to solve the problem, hypothesis is
suggested but no problem can be solved without
rational thinking. So, hypothesis is said to be
the result of rational activity.
(6)

(1)

Keen and creative imagination :

Investigators creative imagination is the
mother at all inventions / discoveries. Every
hypothesis has its source in imaginative mind
of the scientist. This is the reason why common
person cannot suggest a good hypothesis.

Result of keen and creative imagination -

Every hypothesis originates out of a
problematic situation. However, to perceive
and solve the problem is not easy. Hypothesis
is the result of the scientist’s keen and creative
imagination.

For example : Every farmer must have
observed apples falling on the ground but it was
Newton’s creative imagination which led to the
discovery of the theory of gravitation.

For example : In the year 1795, Nicolas
Appert observed that Napoleon Bonapart
regularly shipped food for his military. But
the food would spoil by the time it reached its

(2)

Painstaking work :

Though keen imagination is the most
important factor of thinking of hypothesis,
79

along with it, painstaking work of scientist is
also important. Without hardwork only with
keen imagination rarely any discovery can take
place in science. Scientist may have to work for
months and years together to find a solution to
the problem.  
For example : Kepler is said to have
considered nineteen wrong hypothesises before
he hit upon the right hypothesis that “planets
revolve in elliptical orbits”.
(3)

(5)

Adequate and wide knowledge :

Chance too plays its part in suggesting a
fruitful hypothesis. Some of the great discoveries
take place due to the chance observations.
However, great discoveries are never accidental.
The so called accident is merely a chance
observation which a scientist is able to use
due to his specialised knowledge and creative
imagination.

It means that investigation and painstaking
work must be backed by adequate knowledge of
the subject in which the investigation is being
done.
For example : Diseases of silk worms
Louis Pasteur was the only scientist in
France, who could cure the disease of the silk
worm, as he had adequate knowledge of diseases
in general, though he had no knowledge of silk
worms.
(4)

Chance / Accident :

For example : the discovery of penicillin
by Alexander Fleming was the outcome of
chance observation. In September 1928, before
proceeding on week’s vacation Alexander
Fleming had started some germ cultures. On his
return, he examined these cultures. He picked up
one dish from the window ledge, and found that
the culture had been spoiled. There were other
bacterias in it. As he was about to throw it away
he observed that, around a small patch of mould,
there were no germs. This suggested to his mind
the hypothesis that the mould was giving out
some substance which was preventing germs
from growing in its neighbourhood. That led
to the discovery of penicillin.

Insight :

Scientist work hard to solve the problem
but it may not always give a solution to the
problem. Sometimes the right solution comes as
a sudden flash of lightening called as insight.
For example : when Archemedes jumped
into the tub containing water and observed that
water was thus thrown out of the tub, he got
the solution to his problem. He then framed
a hypothesis that ‘when a body is partially
immersed in water, it loses weight and the loss
of the weight of the body is equal to the water
thrown out of the tub.’ This hypothesis struck his
mind as a sudden flash of insight.

80

problem but they are the ones which the
scientist think worth considering.

Alexander Fleming could take advantage
of the “chance” observation, because he had
specialized knowledge about Lysozyme.
(Lysozyme is a natural property by which germs
are destroyed). Sir Alexander Fleming used
to demonstrate that tears from the eye possess
the property of lysozyme. He would, take in a
test tube, a solution containing germs. Then he
would take a tear from the eye and drop it in
to the solution. Suddenly the solution would
become clear. The germs were destroyed.

Such worth considering hypothesis
is called a good hypothesis and such good
hypothesis are said to have scientific value. A
hypothesis is considered to be good if it satisfies
certain conditions as follows ...
(1)

A hypothesis must be relevant. The
function of hypothesis is to explain the facts
which have become a problem. It can serve this
purpose only if the hypothesis is relevant to the
problem.

Alexander Fleming could understand
why there were no germs around the mould,
because he was familiar with lysozyme. So we
see that a chance observation merely provides an
opportunity of coming across the phenomenon.
But a trained mind is required to understand the
significance of the unexpected occurance.
(6)

Relevance :

A relevant hypothesis is one from which
the facts to be explained can be deduced as a
logical consequences. As per this definition
when the hypothesis is proposed, one may not
know whether it is relevant. Scientist may have
to observe more facts to determine whether it is
relevant. Therefore, the condition of relevance
only means that in the light of specialised
knowledge, the scientist genuinely believes that
the hypothesis is relevant.

Induction per simple enumeration and
Analogy -

These are common mans methods
of arriving at conclusion. Sometimes these
conclusions may suggest hypothesis to scientist.
When a generalization is supported by
positive instances and no contrary instance
has been observed, the method of simple
enumeration is said to be used.

For example : Hypothesis suggested by
followers of Galen is a good example of irrelevant
hypothesis. Galen theory suggested that human
thigh bones are curved. Later Vasalius proved
that human thigh bones are straight. He did
this by dissecting human bodies which was not
allowed at the time of Galen. One of the Galen’s
follower however could not accept this theory.
So he suggested a hypothesis that, in natural
conditions the bones are curved and the narrow
trousers worn in those days were responsible for
straightness of bones. It is very obvious that this
hypothesis is irrelevant. These type of trousers
have nothing to do with shape of bones.

An analogy is an inference in which the
conclusion is drawn on the basis of observed
resemblances.
For example : Conclusion of Lowells’s
analogy of Earth and Mars, that there is life on
Mars has become a hypothesis in science.
7.5 Conditions of good hypothesis :
Hypothesis is a guess work and need to be
tested or verified only then it is accepted. But
verifying each and every hypothesis becomes
a laborous, time consuming and complicated
process.

(2)

Hypothesis must be self-consistent :

Hypothesis must not be inconsistent. There
must be no contradiction among its differnt
elements.

Hence, scientists do not verify each and
every hypothesis. They select few hypotheses
for further verification. These selected few
hypotheses are not true solution to the

For example, the hypothesis of “living
ghost” or that of “weightless matter” is
inconsistent.
81

(3)

(5)

Hypothesis must be testable :

According to Irving Copi, the important
condition of good hypothsis is testability or
verifiability. One of the important conditions
of scientific hypothesis. In order to confirm a
hypothesis, it has to be verified.

A good hypothesis is not only capable of
explaining those facts for which it is proposed
but also can explain some more facts.
For example : Newton’s law of Gravitation
not only explained the falling of an apple to
the ground but also the planatory motions and
phenomenon of tides.

For example : A hypothesis related to
ghost, evil etc. are now regarded as unscientific.
They are not empirically verifiable. Thus a good
hypothesis is said to be testable or verifiable.
Hypothesis is verifiable means it is capable of
being shown to be either true or false.

(6)

Hypothesis must have predictive power :

If the researcher deduces more
consequences from the hypothesis, then it is said
that the hypothesis has greater predictive power.
From this predictive power it becomes clear that
a given hypothesis is not a scientists fancy of
mind and is based on facts.

Verification is a process by which a
hypothesis is confirmed. However there is no
time limit within which a hypothesis is verified.
So hypothesis should be verifiable in principle.
For example : the ultimate destruction of
life on Earth is a good hypothesis, it cannot be
verified today. But it is verifiable in principle.
(4)

Hypothesis must have explanatory
power :

(7)

Hypothesis must be simple :

Scientist prefer the simpler of the rival
hypothesises but they define simplicity in
different ways. According to one view, a simpler
hypotheses is one which makes the minimum
number of independent assumptions.
It explains facts without being vague, obscure,
ambiguous and complex ideas. Sometimes, it
so happens that the researcher has to choose
from the rival hypothesis. In such a situation,
he chooses the hypothesis on the basis of its
simplicity.

Hypothesis must be compatible with
pre-established knowledge :

The goal of science is to establish a
deductive system. One of the conditions of a
system is consistency i.e. all laws included in a
system must be compatible with one another.
If a new hypothesis is not compatible with
established  laws then it’s chances of being true
are very less. It is therefore said that a good
hypothesis is one which is compatible with
previously established laws. However sometimes
it is also possible that the new hypothesis which
is inconsistent with established laws turns out to
be correct in that case the previously established
law turns out to be incorrect.

Historically, the most important pair of
such hypothesis were those of Ptolemy and
Copernicus. Ptolemy put forth a theory that the
earth is in the centre and the Sun and other planets
revolve round the earth. On the other hand,
Copernicus put forth a hypothesis that the Sun
is in the centre and the earth and other planets
revolve round the Sun. Both the hypotheses
were equally good. The Copernican hypothesis
was simpler than Ptolemic hypothesis and it
was accepted, as it hardly made any number of
independent assumptions

For example : The Copernicus system
overthrew the Ptolemic system, even though the
Ptolemic system was well established.

from air was heavier than Nitrogen from other
sources.

7.6 Verification of hypothesis A hypothesis is a tentative solution. When
a hypothesis is formulated and known to be
good, next step in scientific investigation is its
verification.

(2)

Most of the scientific hypotheses cannot
be verified directly. Such hypotheses are
called non-instantial hypothesis. They can be
verified indirectly.

Verification of a hypothesis consists in
finding out whether it agrees with facts. If it
agrees with the facts, it is confirmed. If it does not
agree with facts, it may be rejected or modified.

Indirect verification consist in deducing
the consequences from a hypothesis and testing
those consequences by appeal to facts.

Kinds of Verification :

Thus, two steps are involved in indirect
verification -

There are two ways of verifying a
hypothesis. These are Direct Verification and
Indirect Verification. Hypotheses that are
verified directly are termed as empirical
hypotheses or instantial hypothesis and those
which are verified indirectly are termed as
theoretical or non-instantial hypotheses.
(1)

(A) Deductive development of hypothesis
- Deductive development of hypothesis
means by assuming hypothesis as true
certain consequences are deduced from
the hypothesis.
(B)

Direct Verification :

It consists in observing the facts to which
the hypothesis refers. Here we are appealing to
facts directly. Direct Verification may be either
by observation or by experimentation.
H

Indirect verification :

To find out whether the anticipated or
predicted consequences take place. If the
predictions come true, the hypothesis is
said to be indirectly verified.

In indirect verification, the consequences
are tested either by observation or by experiment.

F1 F2 F3

For example : Kon - Tiki Expedition

When actual observation shows that things
referred in a hypothesis are actually found
existing then it is called direct verification by
observation.

It was observed that there are certain
similarities between the ancient customs of
natives of South sea Islands and the inhabitants
of South America, inspite of the distance
between them. Some sociologists proposed the
hypothesis that the natives of the South sea
Islands came from South America.

For example : Discovery of Neptune.
When hypothesis is verified by experiment
in laboaratory, it is called direct verification by
experimentation.
For example : While explaining the
phenomenon that “Nitrogen from air was heavier
than Nitrogen from other sources”, Rayleigh’s  
hypothesis that “there may be some unknown
gas present in air” was verified directly by
performing an experiment. An unknown gas was
isolated from Nitrogen obtained in the air. This
gas was named Argon. The presence of this gas
confirmed the hypothesis. Hence the hypothesis
was accepted as it could explain why Nitrogen
83

This hypothesis cannot be verified directly
so to verify it indirecly scientist deduced the
consequences that, if it is true that the people
travelled from South America to South sea island
then they must have travelled by sea route using
primitive kind of a boat.

as true, our argument commits the fallacy of
affirming the consequent as explained below :
place

If H is true then C1, C2, C3 should take
C1, C2, C3 take place
\ H is true

This hypothesis was confirmed by
conducting an experiment. Scientists undertook
a trip in such a boat. The prevailing currents
carried them to the destination. They arrived on
the islands after a little over hundred days.

Indirect verification only shows that
hypothesis may be true becuase it does not rule
out the possibility that same consequences can
take place due to some other reason, other than
the hypothesis.

Limits of verification Verification shows that “C” is the cause
of “E” but does not show that “C” is the
only cause of “E”. It shows that the hypothesis
explains the observed fact quite well but does
not show that it is the only explanation for the
observed facts.

It is therefore necessary to prove the
hypothesis. In proof of a hypothesis we attempt
to show that the consequences can take place
only due to the proposed hypothesis. The form
of such an argument is as follows and it is not
fallacious.

Most of the hypotheses are verified
indirectly in science.

If and only if H, then C1, C2 , C3 take place.
C1, C2, C3 take place

In direct verification there is hardly any
doubt about truth of the hypotheses. But in
indirect verification if hypothesis is accepted

\H
Thus proof of hypothesis consists in
showing that no other hypothesis can explain
the facts. In other words it is the only possible
hypothesis which can explain the facts.

Conditional Proposition (Traditional logic)
is one in which the assertion is made subject to

Obversion is a process of immediate inference
in which the subject term remains the same
but the predicate term in the conclusion is

relationship between two classes, class of subject
term and class of predicate term.
